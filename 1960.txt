theres always one like that in every time of history most of them were varmints but every once in a while in one of them there may have lived a man he lay face down in the desert sand clutching his sixgun in his hand shot from behind i thought he was dead for under his heart was an ounce of lead but a spark still burned so i used my knife and late that night i saved the life of ringo ringo ringo i nursed him til the danger passed the days went by he mended fast and then from dawn til setting sun he practiced with that deadly gun and hour on hour i watched in awe no human being could match the draw of ringo ringo ringo one day we rode the mountain crest and i went east and he went west i took to law and wore a star while he spread terror near and far with lead and blood he gained such fame all through the west they feared the name of ringo ringo ringo i knew someday id face the test which one of us would be the best and sure enough the word came down that he was holed up in the town i left the posse out in the street and i went in alone to meet ringo ringo ringo they said my speed was next to none but my lightning draw had just begun when i heard a blast that stung my wrist the gun went flying from my fist and i was looking down the bore of the deadly 44 of ringo ringo ringo they say that was the only time that anyone had seen him smile he slowly lowered his gun and then he said to me were even friend and so at last i understood that there was still a spark of good in ringo ringo ringo i blocked the path of his retreat he turned and stepped into the street a dozen guns spit fire and lead a moment later he lay dead the town began to shout and cheer nowhere was there shed a tear for ringo ringo the story spread throughout the land that i had beaten ringos hand and it was just the years they say that made me put my guns away but on his grave they cant explain the tarnished star above the name of ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo lonely im mr lonely i have nobody for my own

because a vision softly creeping left its seeds while i was sleeping and the vision that was planted in my brain still remains within the sound of silence in restless dreams i walked alone narrow streets of cobblestone neath the halo of a street lamp i turned my collar to the cold and damp when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light that split the night and touched the sound of silence and in the naked light i saw ten thousand people maybe more people talking without speaking people hearing without listening people writing songs that voices never shared and no one dared disturb the sound of silence fools said i you do not know silence like a cancer grows hear my words that i might teach you take my arms that i might reach you but my words like silent raindrops fell and echoed in the wells of silence and the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made and the sign flashed out its warning in the words that it was forming and the sign said the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls and whispered in the sound of silence what you want baby i got it what you need do you know i got it all im askin is for a little respect
