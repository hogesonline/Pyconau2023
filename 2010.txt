friends but ill admit that i was glad it was over but you didnt have to cut me off make out like it never happened and that we were nothing and i dont even need your love but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough no you didnt have to stoop so low have your friends collect your records and then change your number i guess that i dont need that though now youre just somebody that i used to know now youre just somebody that i used to know now youre just somebody that i used to know now and then i think of all the times you screwed me over but had me believing it was always something that id done but i dont wanna live that way reading into every word you say you said that you could let it go and i wouldnt catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know but you didnt have to cut me off make out like it never happened and that we were nothing ah and i dont even need your love ooh but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough ah no you didnt have to stoop so low ooh have your friends collect your records and then change your number ah i guess that i dont need that though ooh now youre just somebody that i used to know somebody i used to know somebody
