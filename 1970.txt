stole his thorny crown the courtroom was adjourned no verdict was returned and while lennon read a book on marx the quartet practiced in the park and we sang dirges in the dark the day the music died we were singin byebye miss american pie drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry them good ol boys were drinkin whiskey and rye and singin thisll be the day that i die thisll be the day that i die helter skelter in a summer swelter the birds flew off with a fallout shelter eight miles high and fallin fast it landed foul on the grass the players tried for a forward pass with the jester on the sidelines in a cast now the halftime air was sweet perfume while sergeants played a marching tune we all got up to dance oh but we never got the chance cause the players tried to take the field

hell could break that satan spell and as the flames climbed high into the night to light the sacrificial rite i saw satan laughing with delight the day the music died he was singin byebye miss american pie drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry them good ol boys were drinkin whiskey and rye and singin thisll be the day that i die thisll be the day that i die i met a girl who sang the blues and i asked her for some happy news but she just smiled and turned away i went down to the sacred store where id heard the music years before but the man there said the music wouldnt play and in the streets the children screamed the lovers cried and the poets dreamed but not a word was spoken the church bells all were broken and the three men i admire most the father son and the holy ghost they caught the last train for the coast the day the music died and there i stood alone and afraid i dropped to my knees and there i prayed and i promised him everything i could give if only he would make the music live and he promised it would live once more but this time one would equal four and in five years four had come to mourn and the music was reborn and they were singin byebye miss american pie drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry and them good ol boys were drinkin whiskey and rye singin thisll be the day that i die thisll be the day that i die they were singin

while from now if im not feeling any less sour i promised myself to treat myself and visit a nearby tower and climbing to the top will throw myself off in an effort to make it clear to whoever what its like when youre shattered left standing in the lurch at a church where people saying my god thats tough she stood him up no point in us remaining we may as well go home as i did on my own alone again naturally to think that only yesterday i was cheerful bright and gay looking forward to well who wouldnt do the role i was about to play but as if to knock me down reality came around and without so much as a mere touch cut me into little pieces leaving me to doubt talk about god in his mercy for if he really does exist why did he desert me in my hour of need i truly am indeed alone again naturally it seems to me that there are more hearts broken in the world that cant be mended left unattended what do we do what do we do alone again naturally now looking back over the years and what ever else that appears i remember i cried when my father died never wishing to hide the tears and at sixtyfive years old my mother god rest her soul couldnt understand why the only man she had ever loved had been taken leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken despite encouragement from me no words were ever spoken and when she passed away i cried and cried all day alone again naturally alone again naturally23 theres a port on a western bay and it serves a hundred ships a day lonely sailors pass the time away and talk about their homes and theres a girl in this harbor town

there anything that can like we could really say is totally original kirby ferguson the big bang as far as we know the big bang is original raz and everything else after that ferguson everything else yeah raz you know derivative ferguson yes raz this is kirby ferguson hes a filmmaker and made a series of films called everything is a remix because as kirby explains in those films every painting every song every idea comes from somewhere else and the basic element of creativity comes from remixing ferguson all of our works emerge out of our influences out of building you know upon the works and with the works of other people raz like for example bob dylan raz heres kirby from the ted stage soundbite of ted talk ferguson all right lets head back to 1964 and lets hear where some of dylans early songs came from well do some sidebyside comparisons here all right this first song youre going to hear is nottamun town its your traditional folk tune after that youll hear dylans masters of war soundbite of song nottamun town jean ritchie singing in nottamun town not a soul would look out not a soul would look up not a soul would look down soundbite of song masters of war bob dylan singing come you masters of war and build the big guns you that build the death planes you that build all the bombs ferguson so thats the same basic melody and overall structure this next one is the patriot game by dominic behan alongside that youre going to hear with god on our side by dylan soundbite of song the patriot game dominic behan singing come all ye young rebels and list while i sing for the love of ones land is a terrible thing soundbite of song with god on our side dylan singing oh my name it is nothin my age it means less the country i come from is called the midwest ferguson now theres a lot of these its been estimated that twothirds of melodies dylan used in his early songs were borrowed raz so im hearing all of these bob dylan things right and like its hard for me to say because were talking about bob dylan but he stole all of this stuff if this happened today with twitter like within seconds of the release of his record he would be hammered ferguson he would be yeah i mean it was a different era he was a folk musician and the idea back then was not that you came up with original songs the idea was you took the songs that came before you and you did new things with them you know you would write new lyrics to existing melody or vice versa you contributed to this body of folk music that was the idea back then so he wasnt unusual in what he was doing he was doing what they do in folk music raz and this happens all the time in all kinds of music so take led zeppelin for example who used to listen to another band called spirit ferguson and spirit were you know they havent really stood the test of time but they were a reasonably wellknown band in the 60s and zeppelin toured with them raz which could be why this song is not stairway to heaven its called taurus and it came out two years earlier they basically ripped off taurus ferguson yeah they sound a lot a like and it does sound like the opening of stairway to heaven is fairly difficult to distinguish from that segment of taurus raz kirby there has to be an original idea out there in the world ferguson i dont really think so again you can merge things together and you can do that so much that it can be difficult to tell where something came from you know you can be layering and layering and layering until the end result is really unrecognizable but i think human beings arent really capable of coming up with something from nowhere like i think we just do not do that we build out of materials we use tools to make things thats what we do i dont think we summon things out of the blue raz and even when we think of something as totally new totally different like star wars ferguson george lucas was a famous fan of akira kurosawa raz he was the japanese director who made all those samurai films in the 50s and 60s ferguson just the styling of the jedi knights is very samurai and the look of darth vader like the look of his helmet looks a lot like the armor of samurai warriors and you know the famous cantina scene in the first star wars soundbite of film star wars episode iv a new hope alfie curtis as dr evazan i dont like you either you just watch yourself were wanted men ferguson theres a bragging bad guy who ends up getting his arm chopped off that resembles a scene from i believe its yojimbo raz but heres the thing nobody thinks of star wars as derivative even though it clearly draws upon kurosawas work so wheres the line between copying and building on something that came before ferguson i mean to me its about how much you how much mimicry you do how much of the other artist you are taking so if you take a large chunk of it to me that is where youre being derivative youre being unoriginal you know i think you need to be transforming the things that you copy you need to be recontextualizing them its about where are you taking your copying to and you need to be you know transforming and combining those elements in exciting ways soundbite of ted talk ferguson now american copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others instead these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property now creative works may indeed be kind of like property but its property that were all building on and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared raz so its 2007 soundbite of archived recording steve jobs a widescreen ipod with touch controls a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough internet communications device raz steve jobs on stage at macworld and he introduces the iphone jobs these are not three separate devices this is one device raz its a complete breakthrough jobs and we have invented a new technology called multitouch you can do multifinger gestures on it and boy have we patented it raz ok so that was in 2007 but a year earlier in 2006 an interface designer named jeff han gave a ted talk describing the very same technology and kirby ferguson actually showed that footage of jeff han in his ted talk soundbite of ted talk ferguson lets hear what jeff han has to say about this newfangled technology jeff han multitouch sensing isnt anything isnt completely new i mean people like bill buxton have been playing around with it in the 80s the technology you know isnt the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility ferguson so hes pretty frank about it not being new so its not multitouch as a whole thats patented its the small parts of it that are and its in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent to promote the progress of useful arts now this idea that everything is a remix might sound like common sense until youre the one getting remixed raz so remember that picasso quote that mark ronson mentioned a bit earlier well listen to steve jobs in 1996 soundbite of archived recording jobs i mean picasso had a saying he said good artists copy great artists steal and we have you know always been shameless about stealing great ideas raz ok so fastforward 14 years later 2010 when googles android phone started to challenge apples iphone steve jobs was quoted saying this jobs im going to destroy android because its a stolen product im willing to go thermal nuclear war on this ok so in other words great artists steal but not from me raz yeah i mean you think about steve jobs right the idea that he had one point in his career you know that admits to sort of stealing great ideas and then later on in his career saying i will crush those people who steal my ideas is crazy i mean the iphone which is an amazingly beautiful piece of technology is all the result of the work of the people touchscreen technology cell phones and gps and the internet like without any of those things that wouldnt exist ferguson yeah absolutely raz so why wouldnt he acknowledge that ferguson i think its a very individualistic fantasy it makes good stories talking about individuals talking about steve jobs or picasso or whoever its good stories and i think thats what we are geared towards were geared towards stories that are about individuals because thats how we navigate this world so we respond to stories that way whereas telling stories about society about this incredibly complex mass of human activity that is a much harder story to tell raz so how do we start to think about all this in a completely different way ferguson i think it is important to say what you took and from where i think transparency about what youre doing is a big deal nowadays and i think most people just want other people to know that hey like thats my bit you know that little piece of that thing thats mine i did that and i think just you know being more reflective you know when youre on the receiving end of getting copied just think for a moment about where that came from you know is it really yours because we definitely fool ourselves about where our ideas come from raz kirby ferguson hes a filmmaker his movie on originality is called everything is a remix check out his whole talk at tednprorg soundbite of song 4 chords axis of awesome singing time to say goodbye should old acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind im more than a bird im more than a plane im a birdplane so many nights id sit by my window waiting for someone to sing me his song so many dreams ive kept deep inside me alone in the dark but now youve come along and you light up my life you give me hope to carry on you light up my days and fill my

right cause you you light up my life i know your eyes in the mornin sun i feel you touch me in the pourin rain and the moment that you wander far from me i wanna feel you in my arms again and you come
