0 - Poor Little Fool:Ricky Nelson
I used to play around with hearts
That hastened at my call
But when I met that little girl
I knew that I would fall

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

She played around and teased me
With her carefree devil eyes
She'd hold me close and kiss me
But her heart was full of lies

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

She told me how she cared for me
And that we'd never part
And so for the very first time
I gave away my heart

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)
 The next day she was gone
And I knew she'd lied to me
She left me with a broken heart
And won her victory

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

Well, I'd played this game with other hearts
But I never thought I'd see
The day that someone else would play
Love's foolish game with me

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(Poor little fool)1

3 - It's Only Make Believe:Conway Twitty
People see us everywhere
They think you really care
But myself, I can't deceive
I know it's only make believe

My one and only prayer
Is that someday you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you

No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe

My hopes, my dreams come true
My life I'd give for you
My heart, a wedding ring
My all, my everything

My heart I can't control
You rule my very soul
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe
 My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you

No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My prayers, my hopes, my schemes
You are my every dream
But it's only make believe (make believe)2

6 - Smoke Gets in Your Eyes:The Platters
[Verse 1]
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied, something here inside
Cannot be denied
(Do do do, do do do
Do do do ahh)

They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind, ohhh
When your heart's on fire, you must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

[Verse 2]
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love (Ahh)
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
(Without my love)
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies (Ahh)
Smoke gets in your eyes
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
Smoke gets in your eyes 4

11 - The Battle of New Orleans:Johnny Horton
[Verse 1]
In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in a town near New Orleans

[Chorus]
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 2]
We looked down a river
(Hut-two)
And we see'd the British come
(Three-four)
And there must have been a hundred of'em
(Hut-two)
Beatin' on the drums
(Three-four)
They stepped so high
(Hut-two)
And they made their bugles ring
(Three-four)
We stood beside our cotton bales
(Hut-two)
And didn't say a thing
(Two-three-four)
 [Chorus]
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 3]
Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
(One-hut, two-three-four)
If we didn't fire our muskets
(One-hut, two-three-four)
'Till we looked 'em in the eye
(One-hut, two-three-four)
We held our fire
(Hut, two-three-four)
'Till we see their faces well
Then we opened up our squirrel guns
And really gave 'em - well we

[Chorus]
Fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 4]
Yeah, they ran through the briars
(One-hup-two)
And they ran through the brambles
(Hup-two-three-four)
And they ran through the bushes
(Hup-two)
Where the rabbit couldn't go
(Hup-two-three-four)
They ran so fast
(Hup-two)
That the hounds couldn't catch 'em
(One-two-three-four)
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
(One-two, hup-two-three-four)
[Verse 5]
We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fired another round
We filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind

[Chorus]
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 4]
Yeah, they ran through the briars
(Hup-one-two)
And they ran through the brambles
(One-two-three-four)
And they ran through the bushes
(Hup-two)
Where the rabbit couldn't go
(Hup-two-three-four)
They ran so fast
(Hup-two)
That the hounds couldn't catch 'em
(One-two-three-four)
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico1

Hey baby, I ain't asking much of you
No no no no no no no no baby, I ain't asking much of you
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk of love will do

[Verse 1]

You're 'bout to starve me half to death

Still have plenty left, no no no

You're just a natural born beehive
Filled with honey to the top

[Verse 3]
I got a wishbone in my pocket
I got a rabbit foot around my wrist
You know I'd have all of the things my lucky charms could bring
If you give me just a one sweet kiss
Oh no no no no no no no no
Baby, I ain't asking much of you
Just a big a hunk o' hunk o' hunk o' love will do, that's right

16 - Mack the Knife:Bobby Darin
Oh the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear
And he shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has old Macheath, babe
And he keeps it outta sight

You know when that shark bites with his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, though, wears ol' Macheath, babe
So there's never, never a trace of red

Now, on the side walk, ooh Sunday morning, uh huh
Lies a body just oozing life, eek
And someone's sneaking 'round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?

There's a tugboat down by the river, don't you know
Where a cement bag's just a-drooping on down
Oh, that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get ya ten, ol' Mackie's back in town

Now did ya hear 'bout Louie Miller? He disappeared, babe
After drawing out all his hard earned cash
And now Macheath spends just like a sailor
Could it be our boy's done something rash?

Now, Jenny Diver, ho ho, Suky Tawdry
Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya and ol' Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms on the right, babe
Now that Mackie's back in town
 I said, Jenny Diver, woah, Suky Tawdry
Look out, Miss Lotte Lenya and ol' Lucy Brown
Yes, that line forms on the right, babe
Now that Mackie's back in town

Look out ol' Mackie is back6

17 - Mr. Blue:The Fleetwoods
[Intro]
Our guardian star lost all his glow the day that I lost you
He lost all his glitter the day you said no, and his silver turned to blue
Like him, I am doubtful that your love is true
But if you decide to call on me, ask for Mr. Blue

[Verse 1]
I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you love me (I'm Mr. Blue)
Then prove it by goin' out on the sly
Provin' your love isn't true
Call me Mr. Blue

[Verse 2]
I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you're sorry (I'm Mr. Blue)
Then turn around, headin' for the lights of town
Hurtin' me through and through
Call me Mr. Blue

[Bridge]
I stay at home at night (I stay at home)
Right by the phone at night (Right by the phone)
But you won't call
And I won't hurt my pride
Call me Mister
 [Verse 3]
I won't tell you
While you paint the town (I'm Mr. Blue)
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm paintin' it, too
But I'm paintin' it blue
Call me Mr. Blue

[Outro]
Call me Mr. Blue
Call me Mr. Blue1

18 - Heartaches by the Number:Guy Mitchell
[Chorus]
Heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less, each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting, that's the day my world will end

[Verse 1]
Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back but never meant to stay

[Chorus]
Yes, I've got
Heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less, each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting, that's the day my world will end

[Verse 2]
Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited, but you must have lost your way

[Chorus]
Yes, I've got
Heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less, each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting, that's the day my world will end 2

20 - Running Bear:Johnny Preston
[Intro]
*vocalizations*

[Verse 1]
On the bank of the river
Stood Running Bear, young Indian brave
On the other side of the river
Stood his lovely Indian maid
Little White Dove was her name
Such a lovely sight to see
But their tribes fought with each other
So, their love could never be

[Chorus]
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die

[Verse 2]
He couldn't swim the raging river
'Cause the river was too wide
He couldn't reach Little White Dove
Waiting on the other side
In the moonlight he could see her
Throwing kisses 'cross the waves
Her little heart was beating faster
Waiting there for her brave
 [Chorus]
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die

[Verse 3]
Running Bear dove in the water
Little White Dove did the same
And they swam out to each other
Through the swirling stream they came
As their hands touched and their lips met
The raging river pulled them down
Now, they'll always be together
In that happy huntin' ground

[Chorus]
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die

[Outro]

22 - Theme from 'A Summer Place':Percy Faith
There's a summer place
Where it may rain or storm
Yet I'm safe and warm
For within that summer place
Your arms reach out to me
And my heart is free from all care
For it knows

There are no gloomy skies
When seen through the eyes
Of those who are blessed with love

And the sweet secret of
A summer place
Is that it's anywhere
When two people share
All their hopes
All their dreams
All their love

And the sweet secret of a summer place
Is that it's anywhere
When two people share
All their hopes
All their dreams, all their love1

[Chorus]
Don't want your love any more
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown

For when he knows you're telling lies
And he hears them passing by
He's not a man at all

Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown

When you see me shed a tear
And you know that it's sincere
Don't you think it's kind of sad, that you're treating me so bad?
Or don't you even care?

Don't want your kisses , that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound

That's Cathy's clown, that's Cathy's clown 2

Keeps Georgia on my mind

A song of you

37 - Are You Lonesome Tonight?:Elvis Presley
[Verse 1]
Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

[Verse 2]
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?

[Spoken]
I wonder if you are lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage and each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two
You seemed to change, you acted strange
And why, I've never known
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down
 [Outro]
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?5

Blue Moon Moon Moon Moon
Blue Moon Moon Moon Moon
Blue Moon Moon Moon Moon

Blue Moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue Moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper, "Please adore me."
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold, oh

Blue Moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own 2

46 - Running Scared:Roy Orbison
Just runnin' scared each place we go
So afraid that he might show
Yeah, runnin' scared, what would I do?
If he came back and wanted you
Just runnin' scared, feelin' low
Runnin' scared, you love him so
Just runnin' scared, afraid to lose
If he came back which one would you choose
Then all at once he was standing there
So sure of himself, his head in the air
My heart was breaking, which one would it be
You turned around and walked away with me 1

47 - Moody River:Pat Boone
(Moody river, wooh)
(Moody river, wooh)

Moody river more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody river your muddy water
Took my baby's life

Last Saturday evening
Came to the old oak tree
It stands beside the river
Where you were to meet me

On the ground your glove I found
With a note addressed to me
It read, "Dear love, I've done you wrong
Now I must set you free

No longer can I live
With this hurt and this sin
I just couldn't tell you
That guy was just a friend."

Moody river more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody river your muddy water
Took my baby's life
 I looked into the muddy waters
And what could I see?
I saw a lonely, lonely face just
Lookin' back at me

Tears in his eyes
And a prayer on his lips
And the glove of his lost love
At his finger tips

Moody river more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody river your muddy water
Took my baby's life1

[Intro]
Baby
Baby
You did something to me

[Verse 1]
I couldn't sleep at all last night
Just a-thinkin' of you
Baby, things weren't right

[Chorus]
Well, I was tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin'
Tossin' and turnin' all night

[Verse 2]
I kicked the blankets on the floor
Turned my pillow upside down
I never, never did before

[Chorus]
Because I was tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin'
Tossin' and turnin' all night

[Bridge]
Jumped out of bed
Turned on the light
I pulled down the shade
Went to the kitchen for a bite
Rolled up the shade
Turned off the light
I jumped back into bed
It was the middle of the night
 [Verse 3]

'Cause you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There's somethin' that I've got to say

55 - Big Bad John:Jimmy Dean
[Intro]
(Big John)
(Big John)

[Verse 1]
Ev'ry mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood six foot six and weighed two forty five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew, ya didn't give no lip to Big John

[Chorus]
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

[Verse 2]
Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, he kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, he just said, "Hi" to Big John

[Verse 3]
Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the Promised Land, Big John
 [Chorus]
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

[Verse 4]
Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

[Verse 5]
Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant Oak tree, he just stood there alone, Big John

[Chorus]
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

[Verse 6]
And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out, "There's a light up above"
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, Big John
[Verse 7]
With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And as smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John

[Chorus]
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

[Verse 8]
Now they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand
At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man, Big John

[Chorus]
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)3

71 - Monster Mash:Bobby "Boris" Pickett and the Crypt-Kickers
[Verse 1]
I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

[Chorus]
He did the mash, he did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash

[Verse 2]
From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

[Chorus]
They did the mash, they did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They did the mash, it caught on in a flash
They did the mash, they did the monster mash

[Verse 3]
The Zombies were having fun, the party had just begun
The guests included Wolfman, Dracula, and his son
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'
 [Chorus]
They played the mash, they played the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash
They played the mash, they played the monster mash

[Verse 4]
Out from the coffin', Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said
"Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?"
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash

[Verse 5]
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you

[Chorus]
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash
[Outro]
Igor: Mash good!
Mad Scientist: Easy, Igor, you impetuous young boy
Igor: Mash good! Grrr!5

Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

Like a queen with her king
Oh, what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearin' his ring

You would cry too if it happened to you

Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

And the stars begin to twinkle in the night

[Intro: Mary, & Mary-Ann and Margie]
Is she really going out with him?
Well, there she is. Let's ask her
Betty, is that Jimmy's ring you're wearing?
Mhm
Gee, it must be great riding with him
Is he picking you up after school today?
Mnm
By the way, where'd you meet him?
I met him at the candy store
He turned around and smiled at me
You get the picture?
Yes, we see
That's when I fell for the Leader of the Pack

[Verse 1: Mary, & Mary Ann and Margie]
My folks were always putting him down (Down, down)
They said he came from the wrong side of town
(What you mean when you say
That he came from the wrong side of town?)
They told me he was bad
But I knew he was sad
That's why I fell for the Leader of the Pack

[Verse 2: Mary, & Mary Ann and Margie]
One day my Dad said, "Find someone new"
I had to tell my Jimmy, "We're through"
(What you mean when you say
That you better go find somebody new?)
He stood there and asked me why
But all I could do was cry
I'm sorry I hurt you, the Leader of the Pack
 [Bridge: Mary, & Mary Ann and Margie]
He sort of smiled and kissed me goodbye
The tears were beginning to show
As he drove away on that rainy night
I begged him to go slow
Whether he heard, I'll never know

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Look out, look out, look out, look out!

[Verse 3: Mary, & Mary Ann and Margie]
I felt so helpless, what could I do?
Remembering all the things we've been through
In school they all stop and stare
I can't hide my tears, but I don't care
I'll never forget him, the Leader of the Pack

[Outro (Fade): Mary, & Mary Ann and Margie]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Seems to help, I know, downtown

The Eastern world, it is explodin'

And even the Jordan River has bodies floatin'

But you tell me over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

And marches alone can't bring integration
When human respect is disintegratin'
This whole crazy world is just too frustratin'
 [Chorus]
And you tell me over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

Think of all the hate there is in Red China
Then take a look around to Selma, Alabama
Ah, you may leave here, for four days in space
But when you return, it's the same old place

You can bury your dead, but don't leave a trace
Hate your next-door neighbor, but don't forget to say grace

[Chorus]
And tell me over and over and over and over again, my friend
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction
No, no, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction8

And every day I thank you, love
For a feeling that's so new
So inviting, so exciting

Whenever you're near, I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Pulling me closer, closer to your arms

A feeling so divine
Till I leave the past behind
I'm lost in a world
Made for you and me

Whenever you're near, I hear a symphony
Play sweet and tenderly
Every time your lips meet mine, now, baby, baby, baby

Don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me

139 - We Can Work It Out:The Beatles
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight or say good night

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long

We can work it out
We can work it out

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
We can work it out
We can work it out13

141 - Lightnin' Strikes:Lou Christie
Listen to me, baby
You gotta understand
You're old enough to know the makings of a man

Listen to me, baby
It's hard to settle down
Am I asking too much for you to stick around

Every boy wants a girl
He can trust to the very end
Baby, that's you
Won't you wait but 'til then

When I see lips begging to be kissed (stop)
I can't stop (stop)
I can't stop myself
(Stop, stop)

Lightning is striking again
Lightning is striking again
Nature's taking over my one-track mind

Believe it or not
You're in my heart all the time
All the girls are saying that you'll end up a fool
 For the time being, baby, live by my rules
When I settle down
I want one baby on my mind
Forgive and forget
And I'll make up for all lost time
If she's put together fine

And she's readin' my mind (stop)
I can't stop (stop)
I can't stop myself
(Stop, stop)

Lightning is striking again
Lightning is striking again
And again and again and again

[Instrumental]

Lightning is striking again
Lightning is striking again

There's a chapel in the pines
Waiting for us around the bend
Picture in your mind
Love forever, but 'til then
If she gives me a sign
That she wants to make time (stop)
I can't stop (stop)
I can't stop myself
(Stop, stop)

Lightning is striking again
Lightning is striking again
And again and again and again

Lightning is striking again
And again and again and again1

147 - When A Man Loves A Woman:Percy Sledge
When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down

When a man loves a woman
He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playin' him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see
 When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong
He can never want
Some other girl

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
Cause baby, baby, you're my world

When a man loves a woman...6

148 - Paint It Black:The Rolling Stones
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

[Verse 2]
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

[Verse 3]
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

[Verse 4]
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes
 [Verse 5]
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

[Outro]
I wanna see it painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted
Painted black, yeah85

150 - Strangers In The Night:Frank Sinatra
[Verse 1]
Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wondering in the night, what were the chances?
We'd be sharing love before the night was through

[Verse 2]
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you

[Chorus]
Strangers in the night
Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away and

[Verse 3]
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away

[Verse 1]
Hot town, summer in the city
Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around, people looking half-dead
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head

[Chorus]
But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on, and dance all night
Despite the heat, it'll be alright
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
The days can't be like the nights
In the summer, in the city
In the summer, in the city

[Verse 2]
Cool town, evenin' in the city
Dressin' so fine and lookin' so pretty
Cool cat, lookin' for a kitty
Gonna look in every corner of the city
'Til I'm wheezin' like a bus stop
Running up the stairs, gonna meet you on the rooftop

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on, and dance all night

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl

When I say we'll be cool, I think that you know what I mean
We stood on a beach at sunset, do you remember when?
I know a beach where, baby, a-it never ends

Blow your little mind

[Intro]
I need love, love
To ease my mind
I need to find, find
Someone to call mine
But Mama said

"You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take" (Can't wait)

No, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time (Love don't come easy)
No matter how long it takes"

But how many heartaches
Must I stand
Before I find a love
To let me live again?

"(You can't hurry love)
No, you just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take" (Can't wait)

How much more can I take
Before loneliness (Love don't come easy)
Will cause my heart, heart to break?

To live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love
To call my own
But when I feel that I
I can't go on

No, you just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take" (Can't wait)

She said, "Trust, give it time (Love don't come easy)
No matter how long it takes"
(Now break!)

No, love, love
Don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating
For that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight

[Chorus]
I keep waiting (Can't wait, ooh, until that day)
I keep on waiting
But it ain't easy (Love don't come easy)
It ain't easy, but Mama said
"You can't hurry love (Ooh, until that day)
No, you just have to wait"
She said, "Trust, give it time (Love don't come easy)
No matter how long it takes"

No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy"3

164 - I'm a Believer:The Monkees

Meant for someone else, but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried

Not a trace of doubt in my mind

Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
While the sun is bright, or in the darkest night
No one knows, she comes and goes
[Chorus]
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

She just can't be chained to a life where nothing's gained

Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

Dying all the time, lose your dreams and you
Will lose your mind, ain't life unkind?"

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus: Paul McCartney with John Lennon & George Harrison]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

[Piccolo Trumpet Solo]
 [Chorus: Paul McCartney with John Lennon & George Harrison]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

[Verse 5: Paul McCartney]
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus: Paul McCartney with John Lennon & George Harrison]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

[Chorus: Paul McCartney with John Lennon & George Harrison]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane25

170 - Somethin' Stupid:Nancy Sinatra and Frank Sinatra
[Verse 1: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me

[Refrain: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

[Bridge: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

[Verse 2: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you

[Refrain: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"14

171 - The Happening:The Supremes
[Verse 1]
Hey, life, look at me
I can see the reality
'Cause when you shook me, took me out of my world
I woke up
Suddenly I just woke up to the happening
When you find that you left the future behind
'Cause when you got a tender love
You don't take care of
Then you better beware of the happening

[Chorus]
One day you're up, then you turn around
You find your world is tumbling down
It happened to me, and it can happen to you

[Verse 2]
I was sure, I felt secure
Until love took a detour
Yeah, riding high on top of the world
It happened, suddenly it just happened
I saw my dreams fall apart
When love walked away from my heart
And when you lose that precious love you need
To guide you
Something happens inside you, the happening
 [Chorus]
Now I see life for what it is
It's not all dreams, ooh, it's not all bliss
It happened to me and it can happen to you

[Bridge]
Once
Ooh, and then it happened
Ooh, and then it happened
Ooh, and then it happened
Ooh, and then it happened

[Verse 3]
Is it real, is it fake
Is this game of life a mistake?
'Cause when I lost the love I thought was mine
For certain, suddenly I started hurting
I saw the light too late
When that fickle finger of fate
Yeah, came and broke my pretty balloon
I woke up
Suddenly I just woke up to the happening

[Chorus]
So sure, I felt secure
Until love took a detour
'Cause when you got a tender love you don't
Take care of, then you better beware of1

176 - Ode to Billie Joe:Bobbie Gentry
[Verse 1]
Was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton, and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door, "Y'all, remember to wipe your feet!"
And then she said, "I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today, Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

[Verse 2]
And Papa said to Mama, as he passed around the black-eyed peas
"Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please
There's five more acres in the lower forty I got to plow"
And Mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

[Verse 3]
And brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
"I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

[Verse 4]
Mama said to me, "Child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all mornin', and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billie Joe was throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge"
 [Verse 5]
A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus goin' 'round; Papa caught it, and he died last spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge13

178 - To Sir With Love:Lulu
[Verse 1]
Those schoolgirl days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind
I know they will still live on and on, and on

[Pre-Chorus]
But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try
I'll try

[Chorus]
If you wanted the sky
Write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
"To Sir, with love"

[Verse 2]
The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend

[Pre-Chorus]
A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong, that's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return?
Oh, oh
 [Chorus]
If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To Sir, with love
If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To Sir, with love1

Good sense, innocence, cripplin' mankind
Dead kings, many things I can't define
Occasions, persuasions clutter your mind
Incense and peppermints, the color of time

[Chorus]
Who cares what games we choose?
Little to win, but nothin' to lose

[Bridge]
Incense and peppermints, meaningless nouns
Turn on, tune in, turn your eyes around
Look at yourself, look at yourself, yeah, girl
Look at yourself, look at yourself, yeah, girl, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
To divide the cockeyed world in two
Throw your pride to one side, it's the least you can do
Beatniks and politics, nothin' is new
A yardstick for lunatics, one point of view
 [Chorus]
Who cares what games we choose?
Little to win, but nothin' to lose

[Verse 3]
Good sense, innocence, cripplin' mankind
Dead kings, many things I can't define
Occasions, persuasions clutter your mind

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer

And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed

Watching the tide roll away
Ooh-wee, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay

185 - Honey:Bobby Goldsboro
See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it, was just a twig

Then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago

And it would sure embarrass her
When I came in from workin' late
Cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there and cryin'
Over some sad and silly late, late show

And honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could
 She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly
And caught her cryin' needlessly
In the middle of the day
And it was in the early Spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away
And honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

One day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone
The angels came
Now all I have is memories of Honey
And I wake up nights and call her name

Now my life's an empty stage
Where Honey lived and Honey played
And love grew up
And a small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed
That Honey loved
And see the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
And I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it, was just a twig1

Let me jump in your game

[Verse 1]
She's walking down the street
Blind to every eye she meets
Do you think you'll be the guy
To make the queen of the angels sigh?

[Chorus]
Hello, I love you
Won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game
Hello, I love you
Won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game
 [Verse 2]
She holds her head so high
Like a statue in the sky
Her arms are wicked, and her legs are long
When she moves my brain screams out this song

Sidewalk crouches at her feet
Like a dog that begs for something sweet
Do you hope to make her see, you fool?
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?

[Outro]
Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello
I want you
Hello
I need my baby
Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello...9

191 - Harper Valley P.T.A.:Jeannie C. Riley
[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you all a story
About a Harper Valley widowed wife
Who had a teenage daughter
Who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well, her daughter came home one afternoon
And didn't even stop to play
And she said, "Mom, I got a note here
From the Harper Valley PTA"

[Verse 2]
Well the note said, "Mrs. Johnson
You're wearin' your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinking
And a-running round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be
A-bringin' up your little girl this way"
And it was signed by the Secretary
Harper Valley PTA

[Verse 3]
Well, it happened that the PTA
Was gonna meet that very afternoon
And they were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson
Wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard
I can still recall the words she had to say
She said, "I'd like to address this meeting
Of the Harper Valley PTA"
 [Verse 4]
"Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there
And seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice
Whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker can you tell us why
Your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down?"

[Verse 5]
"Well, Mr Harper couldn't be here
'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath
You'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me
You think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Peyton Place
And you're all Harper Valley hypocrites"

[Outro]
No, I wouldn't put you on because it really did
It happened just this way
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA4

Hey, Jude, don't make it bad

Then you can start to make it better

193 - Love Child:Diana Ross & the Supremes
[Intro]
(Tenement slum
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
You think that I don't feel love (I'll always love you)
But what I feel for you is real love
In those eyes, I see reflected (I'll always love you)
A hurt, scorned, rejected (Love you)

[Hook]
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me

[Verse 1]
Started my life in an old, cold, rundown tenement slum (Tenement slum)
My father left, he never even married Mom
I shared the guilt my mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, this love we're contemplating (I'll always love you)
Is worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating (I'll always love you)
The child we may be creating (Love you)
 [Hook]
Love child, never meant to be (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Love child, (Scorned by) Society
Love child, always second best (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Love child, (Different from) Different from the rest

[Post-Chorus]
(Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby
(Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby

[Verse 2]
I started school in a worn, torn dress that somebody threw out (Somebody threw out)
I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, don't think that I don't need you (I'll always love you)
Don't think I don't wanna please you
But no child of mine will be bearing (I'll always love you)
The name of shame I've been wearing (Love you)

[Hook]
Love child, love child, never quite as good (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood (Just a little bit longer, love child)
But I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)
I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)
I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)

You, you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)
Always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
You (Just a little bit longer, love child)
You (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)
Take a look, take a look at me (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Love child, love child (Just a little bit longer, love child)
I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)1

194 - I Heard It Through the Grapevine:Marvin Gaye
[Verse 1]
Ooh-ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)

[Verse 2]
I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears, I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life, you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else
Instead
 [Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)

[Verse 3]
People say believe half of what you see
Son, and none of what you hear
But I can't help being confused
If it's true please tell me, dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?
Don't you know

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
I heard it through the grapevine
Ooh, I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)

[Outro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honey, honey, I know (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)
That you're letting me go (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said I heard it through the grapevine (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)
Ooh, heard it through the grapevine (Yeah, yeah, yeah)8

The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in

[Chorus]
I am everyday people, yeah, yeah

There is a blue one who can't accept the green one
For living with a fat one, trying to be a skinny one

We got to live together

[Chorus]
I am everyday people, yeah, yeah
 [Bridge 2]
There is a long hair that doesn't like the short hair
For being such a rich one, that will not help the poor one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee

[Refrain]
Ooh, sha sha
We got to live together

[Bridge 3]
There is a yellow one that won't accept the black one
That won't accept the red one, that won't accept the white one
Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee

That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

[Verse 1]
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
I'm standin' here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breakin' it's early morn
The taxi's waitin', he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could cry

Oh babe, I hate to go

[Verse 2]
There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around

Every song I sing I sing for you
When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring (I'll wear your ring)

Now the time has come to leave you
One more time let me kiss you
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the time I won't have to say (I won't have to say)

[Chorus]
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go

I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go4

Yes we will, yes we will

220 - The Love You Save:The Jackson 5
[Intro]
Stop! Na na na! You'd better save it
Stop, stop, stop, you'd better save it

[Verse 1]
When we played tag in grade school
You wanted to be it
But chasing boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart you'd quit

When we grew up, you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now, just like back to grade school
You're doing the same old thing

[Chorus]
Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or someday, you'll be all alone
You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for a danger zone

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one you need
Those other guys will put you down
As soon as they succeed
 They'll ruin your reputation
They'll label you a flirt
The way they talk about you
They'll turn your name to dirt, oh

[Verse 2]
Isaac said he kissed you
Beneath the apple tree
When Benji held your hand he felt
Electricity

When Alexander called you
He said he rang your chime
Christopher discovered
You're way ahead of your time

[Chorus]
Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or someday, you'll be all alone
You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for a danger zone

[Bridge]
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
S is for "Save it"
T is for "Take it slow"
O is for "Oh, no!"
P is for "Please, please, don't go!"

[Outro]
The love you save may be your own
Some day, you may be all alone
Stop it
Save it, girl
Baby! Ooh

You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own
Please, please
Or someday, someday, baby, you'll be all alone

I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one you need
Those other guys will put you down as soon as they succeed

Stop! The love you save may be your own, baby
You'd better stop it, stop it, stop it, girl
Or someday, you'll be all alone

The way they talk about you
They'll turn your name, turn your name to dirt
Stop! The love you save may be your own!
Don't 'cha know, don't 'cha know
Someday, baby, you'll be all alone
Wait a while
Those other guys will put you down as soon as they succeed7

Want some whiskey in your water?

Don't know what it is
I don't wanna see no more

[Intro]
(War, huh) Yeah!
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, uhuh

(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Say it again, y'all!
(War, huh) Lookout!
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Listen to me, awwwww!

[Verse 1]
War I despise
'Cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War means tears to thousands of mothers' eyes
When their sons go out to fight and lose their lives
I said

[Hook]
(War, huh) Good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it again
(War, huh) Lord, lord, lord, lord
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Listen to me!

[Verse 2]
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), Friend only to the undertaker, awwww
War is the enemy of all mankind
The thought of war blows my mind
War has caused unrest, within the younger generation
Induction then destruction
Who wants to die?
Awwww!
 [Hook]
(War, huh) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it, say it, say it
(War, huh) Oh-ohh yeah, huh

[Verse 3]
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), It's got one friend, that's the undertaker, awwww
War has shattered many young men's dreams
Made them disabled, bitter and mean
Life is much too short and precious to be fighting wars these days
War can't give life, it can only take it away, awwww!

[Hook]
(War, huh) Good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it
(War, huh) Lord, lord, lord, lord
(What is it good for?) Oh, absolutely nothing
Listen to me

[Verse 4]
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), Friend only to the undertaker, woooo!
Peace, love and understanding
Tell me, is there no place for them today?
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But Lord knows there's gotta be a better way, ooohhh
[Hook]
(War, huh) Good God y'all
(What is it good for?) You tell me, say it, say it, say it, say it
(War, huh) good God y'all

No wind (No wind), no rain (No rain)
Nor winter's cold
Can stop me, babe (Oh, babe), baby (Daby)

Aaah, ooh, aah
Aaah, aah ah
Oooh, ooh

I know, I know you must follow the sun
Wherever it leads
But remember
If you should fall short of your desires
Remember life holds for you one guarantee
You'll always have me
And if you should miss my lovin'
One of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms
That used to hold you so close
Or the lips that used to touch yours so tenderly
Just remember what I told you
The day I set you free

238 - Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian):Paul Revere & the Raiders
[Verse 1]
They took the whole Cherokee nation
Put us on this reservation
Took away our ways of life
The tomahawk and the bow and knife
Took away our native tongue
And taught their English to our young
And all the beads we made by hand
Are nowadays made in Japan

[Chorus]
Cherokee people, Cherokee tribe
So proud to live, so proud to die

[Verse 2]
They took the whole Indian nation
Locked us on this reservation
Though I wear a shirt and tie
I'm still part red man deep inside

[Chorus]
Cherokee people, Cherokee tribe
So proud to live, so proud to die

[Outro]
But maybe someday when they've learned
Cherokee nation will return, will return, will return, will return, will return 1

240 - How Can You Mend a Broken Heart:Bee Gees
[Verse 1]
I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrows

[Chorus]
And, how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

[Verse 2]
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow

How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
And how can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?

244 - Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves:Cher
[Verse 1]
I was born in the wagon of a travellin' show
My Mama used to dance for the money they'd throw
Papa would do whatever he could
Preach a little gospel
Sell a couple bottles of Doctor Good

[Chorus]
Gypsys, tramps and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsies, tramps and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down

[Verse 2]
Picked up a boy just south of Mobile
Gave him a ride, filled him with a hot meal
I was sixteen, he was twenty-one
Rode with us to Memphis
And Papa would'a shot him if he knew what he'd done

Gypsys, tramps and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsies, tramps and thieves
But every night all the men would come around

With his smooth southern style
Three months later I'm a gal in trouble
And I haven't seen him for a while, oh

She was born in the wagon of a travelin' show
Her Mama had to dance for the money they'd throw

We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsies, tramps and thieves

247 - Brand New Key:Melanie

I rode my bicycle past your window last night
I roller skated to your door at daylight
It almost seems like you're avoiding me
I'm okay alone but you got somethin' I need

[Chorus]
Well, I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key

You got a brand new key

248 - American Pie:Don McLean
[Intro]
A long, long time ago
I can still remember how that music
Used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

[Chorus]
So, bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

[Verse 1]
Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now, do you believe in rock 'n' roll
Can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
 [Chorus]
I started singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

[Verse 2]
Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

[Chorus]
We were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"
[Verse 3]
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now, the halftime air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

[Chorus]
We started singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

[Verse 4]
Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So, come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
[Chorus]
He was singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die..."

[Bridge]
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
[Deleted Verse]
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised Him everything I could give
If only He would make the music live
And He promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

[Chorus]
And they were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

[Outro]
They were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', "This'll be the day that I die"125

250 - Without You:Nilsson
[Verse 1]
No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

[Verse 2]
No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

[Chorus]
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore

[Verse 1]
Well, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

Can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore

If living is without you...5

252 - A Horse with No Name:America
[Verse 1]
On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

[Chorus]
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

[Verse 2]
After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead
 [Chorus]
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
Because there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

[Chorus]
You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

253 - The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face:Roberta Flack
[Verse 1]
The first time, ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars
Were the gifts you gave
To the dark, and the endless skies

[Verse 2]
And the first time, ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hand
Like the trembling heart
Of a captive bird
That was there, at my command
My love

[Verse 3]
And the first time, ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy
Would fill the earth
And last, 'til the end of time
My love

[Outro]
The first time, ever I saw
Your face
Your face
Your face
Your face 2

259 - Alone Again (Naturally):Gilbert O'Sullivan
[Verse 1]
Oh, in a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch, at a church
Where people saying
"My God that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home"
As I did on my own

[Refrain]
Alone again, naturally

[Verse 2]
To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, well who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
For if He really does exist
Why did He desert me
In my hour of need?
I truly am indeed
 [Refrain]
Alone again, naturally

[Bridge]
It seems to me that
There are more hearts
Broken in the world
That can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?
What do we do?

[Classical Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
Alone again, naturally

[Verse 3]
Now looking back over the years
And what ever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand, why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
[Refrain]
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally23

260 - Brandy (You're a Fine Girl):Looking Glass
[Verse 1]
There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes

[Verse 2]
And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say "Brandy, fetch another round"
She serves them whiskey and wine

[Chorus 1]
The sailors say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea"

[Verse 3]
Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of a man that Brandy loved

[Verse 4]
He came on a summer's day
Bringing gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home
 [Chorus 2]
The sailor said, "Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea"

[Bridge]
Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes
When he told his sailor's story
She could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its raging glory
But he had always told the truth
Lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand

[Verse 5]
At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say

[Outro]
She hears him say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea
It is, yes, it is"
"Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea
It is, it is, yes, it is"3

261 - Baby, Don't Get Hooked on Me:Mac Davis
[Verse 1]
Girl, you're getting that look in your eyes
And it's starting to worry me
I ain't ready for no family ties
Nobody's gonna hurry me

Just keep it friendly, girl
Cause I don't wanna leave
Don't start clinging to me, girl
Cause I can't breathe

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me, oooh
Cause I'll just use you
Then I'll set you free
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me

[Verse 2]
Girl, you're a hot-blooded woman-child
And it's warm where you're touching me
But I can tell by your trembling smile
You're seein' way too much in me

Girl, don't let your life get tangled up with mine
Cause I'll just leave you
I can't take no clinging vine
 [Chorus]
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me
Cause I'll just use you
Then I'll set you free
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me

Cause I'll just use you
Then I'll set you free
Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me. oh

262 - Ben:Michael Jackson
[Verse 1]
Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you, my friend, will see
You've got a friend in me
(You've got a friend in me)

[Verse 2]
Ben, you're always running here and there
(Here and there)
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
(Anywhere)
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go)

[Bridge]
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now, it's "us", now, it's "we"
(I used to say "I" and "me")
(Now, it's "us", now, it's "we")
 [Verse 3]
Ben, most people would turn you away (Turn you away)
I don't listen to a word they say (A word they say)
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben

[Outro]
(A friend)
Like Ben
(Like Ben)
Like Ben14

My grandmother bought me a cute little toy
Silver bells hangin' on a string

But I never let go of my ding a ling

[Chorus]
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling

[Verse 5]
I remember the girl next door
We used to play house on the kitchen floor
She'd be the queen, I'd be the king
Together we'd play with my ding a ling a ling

My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling

To those of you who never had
Silver bells hanging on a string
So you could play with your own ding a ling

[Verse 1: Dennis Edwards]
It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama, I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Mama just hung her head and said, son

[Chorus]
(Papa was a rolling stone)
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)
(And when he died) All he left us was (Alone)
(Papa was a rolling stone) My son, yeah

(And when he died) All he left us was (Alone)
Well, well

[Verse 2: Dennis Edwards, Melvin Williams and Richard Street]
Hey, mama
Is it true what they say, that papa never worked a day in his life?
And mama, some bad talk goin' round town
Sayin' that papa had three outside children
And another wife, and that ain't right
I heard them talking 'bout papa doing some store front preachin'
Talkin' about saving souls and all the time leechin'
Dealing in dirt, and stealing in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said
 [Chorus]
(Papa was a rolling stone) My son
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)
(And when he died) All he left us was (Alone), hey
(Papa was a rolling stone) Dadgummit
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)
(And when he died) All he left us was (Alone)
Uhh

[Verse 3: Damon Harris and Richard Street]
Hey, mama
I heard papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me, is that what sent papa to an early grave?
Folks say papa would beg, borrow, steal
To pay his bills
Hey, mama
Folks say papa never was much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
Mama looked up with a tear in her eye and said, son

[Chorus]
(Papa was a rolling stone) Well, well, well, well
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home) Hey, yeah, huh
(And when he died) All he left us was alone-lone-lone-lone, alone
(Papa was a rolling stone) Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home) Hey, yeah
(And when he died) All he left us was alone, I said
(Papa was a rolling stone) Yes, he was
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home) Huh-huh-huh

266 - I Am Woman:Helen Reddy
[Verse 1]
I am woman, hear me roar
In numbers too big to ignore
And I know too much to go back an' pretend
'Cause I've heard it all before
And I've been down there on the floor
No one's ever gonna keep me down again

Yes, I've paid the price
But look how much I gained
If I have to, I can do anything

See me standing toe to toe
As I spread my lovin' arms across the land
But I'm still an embryo
With a long, long way to go
Until I make my brother understand

But it's wisdom born of pain
Yes, I've paid the price
But look how much I gained
If I have to, I can face anything

268 - Crocodile Rock:Elton John
[Verse 1]
I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

[Post-Chorus]
Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

[Verse 2]
But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last
 [Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

[Post-Chorus]
Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Singing my life with his words

Telling my whole life with his words

Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words

In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me
As if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong

Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words

Touch me in the mornin'
Then just walk away
We don't have tomorrow
But we had yesterday

[Verse 1]
Hey, wasn't it me who said
That nothin' good's gonna last forever?
And wasn't it me who said
Let's just be glad for the time together?

I can understand your feelin' that way
Everybody's got their life to live

In the cold mornin' light
But I can't watch love die
In the warmth of the night

We used to laugh at the wind behind us?
Didn't we run away and hope
That time wouldn't try to find us?

To a place where no one's ever been?

There's no tomorrow here
There's only love and the time to chase it
(But we had yesterday)
Yesterday's gone, my love
There's only now and it's time to face it

Do you know the meaning?
Of being sanctified, hey, hey
Girl, you give me good feeling
So good, somethin' like sanctified
Oh, do right, baby
Nothing wrong with love
If you want to love me, just let yourself go
Oh baby, let's get it on right now24

285 - Angie:The Rolling Stones
[Verse 1]
Angie, Angie
When will those clouds all disappear?
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?
With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But Angie, Angie
You can't say we never tried
Angie, you're beautiful, yeah
But ain't it time we said goodbye?
Angie, I still love you
Remember all those nights we cried?
All the dreams we held so close
Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?

Oh, Angie, don't you weep
All your kisses still taste sweet
I hate that sadness in your eyes
But Angie, Angie
Ain't it time we said goodbye? Yeah

With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But Angie, I still love you, baby

Come on, baby, dry your eyes
But Angie, Angie
Ain't it good to be alive?

288 - Photograph:Ringo Starr
[Chorus 1]
Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any more

[Verse 1]
I thought I'd make it
The day you went away
But I can't make it
'Til you come home again to stay-yi-yay-yi-yay

[Chorus 2]
I can't get used to living here
While my heart is broke, my tears I cried for you
I want you here to have and hold
As the years go by and we grow old and grey

[Verse 2]
Now you're expecting me
To live without you
But that's not something
That I'm looking forward to

[Chorus 2]
I can't get used to living here
While my heart is broke, my tears I cried for you
I want you here to have and hold
As the years go by and we grow old and grey

It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any more

It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any more

It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any more3

289 - Top of the World:The Carpenters
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Karen Carpenter]
Such a feeling's coming over me
There is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream

[Verse 2]
Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear, it's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

[Chorus]
I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world

[Verse 3]
Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's telling me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me
 [Verse 4]
There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here

[Chorus]
I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world

[Chorus]
I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world12

290 - The Most Beautiful Girl:Charlie Rich
Hey
Did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did, was she crying, crying?

Hey
If you happen to see
The most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her

I woke up this morning
Realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
I knew I'd lost my morning sun

I lost my head and I said some things
Now comes the heartaches that morning brings
I know I'm wrong
And I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me

So, hey
Did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did, was she crying, crying?
 Hey
If you happen to see
The most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her

If you happen to see the most beautiful girl
That walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby

291 - Time in a Bottle:Jim Croce
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
If I could save time in a bottle
The first thing that I'd like to do
Is to save every day till eternity passes away
Just to spend them with you

[Verse 2]
If I could make days last forever
If words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then
Again, I would spend them with you

[Chorus]
But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do, once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with
[Verse 3]
If I had a box just for wishes
And dreams that had never come true
The box would be empty, except for the memory of how
They were answered by you
 [Chorus]
But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do, once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with

Light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories
Of the way we were

[Verse 2]
Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were

Can it be that
It was all so simple then?
Or has time re-written every line?
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?
 [Verse 3]
Memories
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget

So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were

Hmm hmm hmmmmmm hmmm hmmm hmm hmm
Hmmm hmmm hmmmmm hmmmmm hmmmmmmmmmmm1

296 - Seasons in the Sun:Terry Jacks
[Verse 1]
Goodbye to you, my trusted friend
We've known each other since we were nine or ten
Together we've climbed hills and trees
Learned of love and ABC's
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees
Goodbye my friend, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Pretty girls are everywhere
Think of me and I'll be there

[Chorus 1]
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time

[Verse 2]
Goodbye Papa, please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
You tried to teach me right from wrong
Too much wine and too much song
Wonder how I got along
Goodbye Papa, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Little children everywhere
When you see them, I'll be there
 [Chorus 2]
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons, have all gone
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons, have all gone

[Verse 3]
Goodbye Michelle, my little one
You gave me love and helped me find the sun
And every time that I was down
You would always come around
And get my feet back on the ground
Goodbye Michelle, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
With the flowers everywhere
I wish that we could both be there

[Chorus 3]
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons, have all gone
All our lives, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun9

297 - Dark Lady:Cher
[Verse 1]
The fortune queen of New Orleans
Was brushing her cat in her black limousine
On the back seat were scratches from
The marks of men, her fortune she had won
I couldn't see through the tinted glass;
She said, "Home, James" and he hit the gas
I followed her to some darkened room
She took my money, she said, "I'll be with you soon"

[Chorus]
Dark lady laughed and danced
And lit the candles one by one;
Danced to her gypsy music
'Till her brew was done...
Dark lady played black magic
'Till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me
Than I knew myself...

[Verse 2]
She dealt two cards, a queen and a three
And mumbled some words that were so strange to me
And then she turned up a two-eyed jack
My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black
She said, "The man you love is secretly true
To someone else who is very close to you!
My advice is that you leave this place
Never come back, and forget you ever saw my face!"
 [Chorus]
Dark lady laughed and danced
And lit the candles one by one;
Danced to her gypsy music
Till her brew was done...
Dark lady played black magic
Till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me
Than I knew myself...

[Verse 3]
So I ran home and crawled in my bed
I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said
Then I remembered her strange perfume
And how I smelled it once in my own room
So I snuck back and caught her with my man;
Laughing and kissing til they saw the gun in my hand...
The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor--
Dark Lady would never turn a card up anymore!

[Chorus fades out]
Dark lady laughed and danced
And lit the candles one by one;
Danced to her gypsy music
Til her brew was done...
Dark lady played black magic
Till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me
Than I knew myself...2

[Chorus]
Sunshine
On my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes
Can make me cry
Sunshine on the water
Looks so lovely
Sunshine
Almost always makes me high

[Verse 1]
If I had a day
That I could give you

The day just like today

To make you feel this way

On my shoulders makes me happy

As we fell into the sun
And the first one said to the second one there
"I hope you're having fun"
 [Chorus]
Band on the run
Band on the run
And the jailer man and Sailor Sam
Were searching everyone
For the band on the run
Band on the run
For the band on the run
Band on the run

[Verse 2]
Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh
Seeing no one else had come
And a bell was ringing in the village square
For the rabbits on the run

[Chorus]
Band on the run
Band on the run
And the jailer man and Sailor Sam
Were searching everyone
For the band on the run
Band on the run
Yeah, the band on the run
The band on the run
The band on the run
Band on the run
[Verse 3]
Well, the night was falling as the desert world
Began to settle down
In the town they're searching for us everywhere
But we never will be found

[Chorus]
Band on the run
Band on the run
And the county judge, who held a grudge
Will search forevermore
For the band on the run
The band on the run
The band on the run
Band on the run14

306 - Sundown:Gordon Lightfoot
[Verse 1]
I can see her lyin' back in her satin dress
In a room where you do what you don't confess

[Chorus]
Sundown, you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs
Sundown, you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs

She's been lookin' like a queen in a sailor's dream
And she don't always say what she really means

When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain

I can picture every move that a man could make
Getting lost in her lovin' is your first mistake

When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again

I can see her lookin' fast in her faded jeans
She's a hard lovin' woman, got me feelin' mean

[Chorus]
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain
Sundown, you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs
Sundown, you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again4

310 - The Night Chicago Died:Paper Lace
[Intro]
Daddy was a cop on the east side of Chicago
Back in the U.S.A., back in the bad old days

[Verse 1]
In the heat of a summer night
In the land of the dollar bill
When the town of Chicago died
And they talk about it still

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When a man named Al Capone
Tried to make that town his own
And he called his gang to war
With the forces of the law

[Chorus]
I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night it really was
Brother what a fight it really was
Glory be!
I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night the people saw
Brother what a fight the people saw
Yes indeed!
 [Verse 2]
And the sound of the battle rang
Through the streets of the old east side
'Til the last of the hoodlum gang
Had surrendered up or died

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There was shouting in the street
And the sound of running feet
And I asked someone who said
''Bout a hundred cops are dead!"

[Chorus]
I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night it really was
Brother what a fight it really was
Glory be!
I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night the people saw
Brother what a fight the people saw
Yes indeed!

[Verse 3]
Then there was no sound at all
But the clock upon the wall
Then the door burst open wide
And my daddy stepped inside
And he kissed my mama's face
And he brushed her tears away
[Chorus]
The night Chicago died
(Na-na na, na-na-na, na-na-na)
The night Chicago died
Brother what a night the people saw
Brother what a fight the people saw
Yes indeed!

[Outro]
The night Chicago died
(Na-na na, na-na-na, na-na-na)
The night Chicago died
Brother what a night it really was
Brother what a fight it really was
Glory be!

312 - I Shot the Sheriff:Eric Clapton
[Chorus 1]
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy

[Verse 1]
All around in my home town
They're trying to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy
But I say

[Chorus 2]
I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff, and they say it is a capital offense

[Verse 2]
Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what I don't know
Every time that I plant a seed
He said, "Kill it before it grows"
He said, "Kill it before it grows"
I say

[Chorus 2]
 [Verse 3]
Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town
All of a sudden I see sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I shot, I shot him down
I say

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 4]
Reflexes got the better of me
And what is to be must be
Every day the bucket goes to the well
But one day the bottom will drop out
Yes, one day the bottom will drop out
But I say

[Chorus 1]4

Oh-ho-ho-ho
Oh-ho-ho-ho
Oh-ho-ho-ho
Oh-ho-ho-ho

[Chorus]
Everybody was kung fu fighting
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

[Verse 1]
There were funky China men from funky Chinatown
They were chopping them up, they were chopping them down
It's an ancient Chinese art and everybody knew their part
From a feint into a slip and a kicking from the hip

Everybody was kung fu fighting, huh
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening, hey, yeah
But they fought with expert timing

We took a bow and made a stand, started swaying with the hand
A sudden motion made me skip, now we're into a brand new trip

323 - Cat's in the Cradle:Harry Chapin
[Verse 1]
My child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say, "I'm gonna be like you, Dad
You know I'm gonna be like you"

[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home, Dad?"
"I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then"

[Verse 2]
My son turned ten just the other day
He said, "Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw?" I said, "Not today
I got a lot to do." He said, "That's okay"
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
It said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him"

[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home, Dad?"
"I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then"
 [Verse 3]
Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
"Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?"
He shook his head and he said with a smile
"What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later, can I have them please?"

[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home, son?"
"I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad
You know we'll have a good time then"

[Verse 4]
I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, "I'd like to see you if you don't mind"
He said, "I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad
It's been sure nice talking to you"
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me
[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home, son?"
"I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad
We're gonna have a good time then"17

324 - Angie Baby:Helen Reddy
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
You live your life in the songs you hear
On the rock 'n' roll radio
And when a young girl doesn't have any friends
That's a really nice place to go
Folks hoping you'd turn out cool
But they had to take you outta school
You're a little touched, you know, Angie, baby

[Verse 2]
Lovers appear in your room each night
And they whirl you 'cross the floor (Angie)
But they always seem to fade away
When your daddy taps on your door
"Angie girl, are you all right?
Tell the radio goodnight"
All alone once more, Angie, baby

[Chorus]
Angie, baby, you're a special lady
Living in a world of make-believe
Well, maybe

[Verse 3]
Stopping at her house is a neighbor boy
With evil on his mind
'Cause he's been peekin' in Angie's room
At night through her window blind
"I see your folks have gone away
Would you dance with me today?
I'll show you how to have a good time, Angie, baby"
(Angie, baby, Angie, baby)
 [Verse 4]
When he walks in her room
He feels confused like he walked into a play
And the music's so loud, it spins him around
'Til his soul has lost its way
And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
Toward the radio he's bound, never to be found

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
'Cept a crazy girl with a secret lover
Who keeps her satisfied
It's so nice to be insane
No one asks you to explain
Radio by your side, Angie, baby

[Chorus]
Angie, baby, you're a special lady
Living in a world of make-believe
Well, maybe
[Outro]
Well, maybe (Angie, baby, Angie, baby)
Well, maybe (Angie, baby, Angie, baby)
(Angie, baby, Angie, baby)
(Angie, baby, Angie, baby)...3

[Verse 1]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies

Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds

[Verse 1]
I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into

[Verse 2]
Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me

Well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you today
Oh, Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
I've walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world
Of uphill climbing
The tears are in my eyes
And nothing is rhyming

Well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you today

Yesterday's a dream
I face the morning
Crying on a breeze
The pain is calling

And you gave without taking
But I sent you away

Well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you today
Oh, Mandy

Well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you6

328 - Laughter in the Rain:Neil Sedaka
[Verse 1]
Strolling along country roads with my baby
It starts to rain, it begins to pour
Without an umbrella, we're soaked to the skin
I feel a shiver run up my spine
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine

[Chorus]
Oh, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Oh, how I love the rainy days
And the happy way I feel inside

[Verse 2]
After a while we run under a tree (after a while)
I turn to her and she kisses me
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves (there with the beat)
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes
Sharing our love under stormy skies

[Chorus]
Oh, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Oh, how I love the rainy days
And the happy way I feel inside

I feel the warmth of her hand in mine

Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Oh, how I love the rainy days
And the happy way I feel inside1

332 - Best of My Love:Eagles
[Verse 1]
Every night I'm lying in bed
Holding you close in my dreams
Thinking about all the things that we said
And coming apart at the seams
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough

[Refrain]
I know you were trying
To give me the best of your love

[Verse 2]
Beautiful faces
And loud, empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give
That same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above

[Refrain]
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love

Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love
(You get the best of my love)
 [Bridge]
I'm going back in time
And it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping

[Verse 3]
But every morning
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way
And I see it mine
But we both see it slippin' away
You know we always had each other baby
I guess that wasn't enough

[Refrain]
Oh-uh-oh, but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

[Chorus/Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling

335 - My Eyes Adored You:Frankie Valli
[Intro]

[Chorus]
My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me, you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far

[Verse 1]
Carried your books from school
Playing make-believe you're married to me
You were fifth grade, I was sixth
When we came to be

[Verse 2]
Walking home every day, over
Barnegat Bridge and Bay
'Til we grew into the me and you
Who went our separate ways

[Chorus]
My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far
 [Verse 3]
Headed for city lights
Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to the bone
Made myself a name

[Verse 4]
Funny, I seem to find
That no matter how the years unwind
Still I reminisce 'bout the girl I miss
And the love I left behind

[Chorus]
My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far

[Bridge]
All my life I will remember
How warm and tender we were way back then
Though I'm feeling sad regrets
I know I won't ever forget you, my childhood friend
[Instrumental]

[Outro]
(My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you

Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away...)2

342 - Thank God I'm a Country Boy:John Denver
[Verse 1]
Well, life on a farm is kinda laid back
Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack
It's early to rise, early in the sack
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well, a simple kind of life never did me no harm
A-raisin' me a family and working on the farm
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God I'm a country boy

[Chorus]
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

[Verse 2]
When the work's all done and the sun's setting low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
Thank God I'm a country boy
I'd play "Sally Goodin'" all day if I could
But the Lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
So I fiddle when I can and I work when I should
Thank God I'm a country boy
 [Chorus]
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy
Whoo

[Verse 3]
Well, I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels
I never was one of them money hungry fools
I'd rather have my fiddle and my farming tools
Thank God I'm a country boy
Yeah, city folk driving in a black limousine
A lot of sad people thinking that's a-mighty keen
Well son, let me tell you now exactly what I mean
I thank God I'm a country boy
[Chorus]
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

[Fiddle breakdown]

[Verse 4]
Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
And he took me by the hand, held me close to his side
Said, "Live a good life, play my fiddle with pride
Thank God you're a country boy."
My daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
He taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
He taught me how to love and how to give just a little
And thank God I'm a country boy
[Chorus]
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle
Whoo, thank God I'm a country boy, yes!3

351 - Rhinestone Cowboy:Glen Campbell
[Verse 1]
I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

[Chorus]
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

[Verse 2]
Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
 [Chorus]
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

[Bridge]
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

[Fade]
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' card and letters from people I don't even know5

352 - Fame:David Bowie
[Verse 1]
Fame (Fame), makes a man take things over
Fame (Fame), lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame (Fame), puts you there where things are hollow
Fame (Fame)

[Chorus 1]
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane ('Sane)
Fame (Fame)

[Verse 2]
Fame (Fame), what you like is in the limo
Fame (Fame), what you get is no tomorrow
Fame (Fame), what you need, you have to borrow
Fame (Fame)

[Chorus 2]
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame (Fame)

[Bridge]
Could it be the best, could it be?
Really be, really, babe?
Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?
Could it, babe? Could it, babe?
 [Verse 3]
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame (Fame), fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool
Fame (Fame)

[Chorus 3]
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a rain check on pain (Pain)
(Fame)

[Outro]
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame

What's your name?

353 - I'm Sorry:John Denver
[Verse 1]
It's cold here in the city
It always seems that way
And I've been thinking about you
Almost everyday
Thinking about the good times
Thinking about the rain
Thinking about how bad it feels
Alone again

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for the way things are in China
I'm sorry things ain't what they used to be
But more than anything else, I'm sorry for myself
'Cause you're not here with me

[Verse 2]
Our friends all ask about you, I say you're doing fine
And I expect to hear from you almost anytime
But they all know I'm crying and I can't sleep at night
They all know I'm dying down deep inside

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for all the lies I've told you
I'm sorry for the things I didn't say
But more than anything else
I'm sorry for myself
I can't believe you went away
 [Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm sorry
If I took some things for granted
I'm sorry
For the chains I put on you
But more than anything else
I'm sorry for myself
For living without you
It's cold here in the city
It always seems that way
And I've been thinking about you almost every day3

354 - Bad Blood:Neil Sedaka
It could've been me
But it was you
Who went and bit off
A little bit more
Than he could chew

You said that you had it made
But you been had
The woman no good
No how
Thinking maybe the blood is bad

Bad (bad) blood (blood)
The woman was born to lie
Makes promises she can't keep
With the wink of an eye

Bad (bad) blood (blood)
Brother, you've been deceived
It's bound to change your mind
About all you believe

From where I stand
It looks mighty strange
How you let a woman like that
Treat you like small change
 I don't understand
What you're lookin' to find
The only thing bad blood do
Is mess up a good man's mind
Hear me talkin' now

Bad (bad) blood (blood)
The bitch is in her smile
The lie is on her lips
Such an evil child

Bad (bad) blood (blood)
Is takin' you for a ride
The only thing good about bad blood
Is lettin' it slide

Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di
Dit, dit, do-ron-ron
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di
Dit, dit, do-ron-ron

Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di
Dit, dit, do-ron-ron

Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di
Dit, dit, do-ron-ron
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di
Dit, dit, do-ron-ron
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di
Dit, dit, do-ron-ron
Bad blood, here we go

Bad (bad) blood (blood)
The bitch is in her smile
The lie is on her lips
Such an evil child

Bad (bad) blood (blood)
Is takin' you for a ride
The only thing good about bad blood
Is lettin' it slide

The only thing good about bad blood
Is letting it slide1

361 - Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To):Diana Ross
[Hook]
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?

[Verse 1]
Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds
You knew I loved you, but my spirit was free
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me

[Hook]
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?

[Verse 2]
Now, looking back at all we've passed
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be?
 [Hook]
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?3

363 - 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover:Paul Simon
[Verse 1]
"The problem is all inside your head," she said to me
"The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover"
She said, "It's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude"
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

[Chorus]
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
Ooh, slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
 [Verse 2]
She said, "It grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again"
I said "I appreciate that, and would you please explain
About the 50 ways?"
She said, "Why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning, you'll begin to see the light"
And then she kissed me, and I realized she probably was right
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

[Chorus]
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
Slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free9

383 - I Wish:Stevie Wonder
[Verse 1]
Looking back on when I was a little nappy-headed boy
Then my only worry was for Christmas, what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, "Boy, thought I told you not to go outside"
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whoopin' your behind

[Chorus]
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
'Cause I love them so

[Verse 2]
Brother said he's telling 'bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell and I'll give you anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (You nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing ain't right
But while you were doing it, it sure felt outta sight
 [Chorus]
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?6

386 - Blinded by the Light:Manfred Mann's Earth Band
[Intro]
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

[Verse 1]
Madman, drummers, bummers
Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older
I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasin', sneezin' and wheezin'
The calliope crashed to the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
The calliope crashed to the ground!

[Chorus]
But, she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
 [Verse 2]
Some silicone sister with a manager mister
Told me I got what it takes
She said, "I'll turn you on, son, into something strong
Play the song with the funky break"
And go-kart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe outside
And little Early-Pearly came by in his curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride

[Pre-Chorus]
Asked me if I needed a ride!

[Chorus]
But, she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light

[Breakdown]
She got down but she never got tired
She's gonna make it through the night
She's gonna make it through the night

[Instrumental Break 02:54-04:09]

But mama, that's where the fun is
But mama, that's where the fun is
Mama always told me not to look into the eyes of the sun
But mama, that's where the fun is
[Piano Solo]

[Verse 3]
Some brimstone, baritone, anticyclone, rolling stone
Preacher from the east
Says, "Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in it's funny bone that's where they expect it least"
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone reminding him of romance
[Pre-Chorus]
The calliope crashed to the ground!

[Chorus]
But she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

[Counter Chorus]

(The calliope crashed to the ground)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(Now, Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(And throws his lover in the sand)
Blinded by the light
(Some bloodshot forget-me-not said daddy's within earshot)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(Save the buckshot, turn up the band)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(Some silicone sister with a manager mister)
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(Told me I got what it takes)

She got down, but she never got tired
She's gonna make it through the night25

Johnny-come-lately, the new kid in town

Tears on your shoulder

Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Chorus]
You are the dancing queen

Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah

Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night?
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistlin' tunes that you know and love so

[Verse 2]
Southern nights
Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize
To anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

[Verse 3]
Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies? (In Southern sky)
Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes runnin' through your soul
Like the stories told of old

Old man
He and his dog, they walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin' willows would cry for joy, joy
 [Verse 5]
Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da

Mystery
Like this and many others in the trees
Blow in the night

392 - Sir Duke:Stevie Wonder
[Verse 1]
Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance, and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

[Chorus]
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people, go

[Verse 2]
Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget, no
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all, Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose
 [Chorus]
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

[Chorus]
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
I can feel it all, all, all-all-all over the people
Can't you feel it all over?
Come on, let's feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
Everybody, all over people, go11

Spring was never waiting for us, dear
It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
Between the parted pages, we were pressed
In love's hot fevered iron
Like a striped pair of pants

[Chorus]
MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again, again

[Verse 2]
I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground beneath your knees
The birds like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing
Chinese checkers by the trees

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it

After all the loves of my life, you'll still be the one

I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it

You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore

Just come on down, to the 54
And find a spot out on the floor

Ah, freak out
Le freak, c'est chic
Freak out
Ah, freak out
Le freak, c'est chic
Freak out8

422 - Too Much Heaven:Bee Gees
[Hook: Barry, Robin & Maurice Gibb]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
Ooh, you and me, girl got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
Then my life, I can see beyond forever
Everything we are will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
Oh, you make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away?

[Hook: Barry, Robin & Maurice Gibb]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore

You and me, girl, got a highway to the sky
We can turn away
From the night and day
And the tears we had to cry
 [Verse 4: Barry Gibb]
You're my life, I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we are will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
When you are to me the light above
Made for all to see our precious love

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line

You make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away

Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river and harder to climb

[Chorus]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb

423 - Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?:Rod Stewart
[Intro]
Sugar, sugar
Ooh

[Verse 1]
She sits alone waitin' for suggestions
He's so nervous, avoidin' all the questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently poundin'
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinkin'?

[Chorus]
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so (Tell me so, baby)

[Verse 2]
He's actin' shy, lookin' for an answer
Come on, honey, let's spend the night together
Now, hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his high-rise apartment
At last, he can tell exactly what his heart meant

[Chorus]
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, honey, tell me so
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar, let me know, ow

'Cause, at last, he's got this girl home
Relax, baby, now, we are all alone, ow

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
They wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singing
Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside, it's cold, misty and it's raining
They got each other, neither one's complaining
He says, "I'm sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee
Never mind, sugar, we can watch the early movie"

[Chorus]
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so

Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you, if you, if you really need me
Just come on and tell me so7

424 - Tragedy:Bee Gees
[Verse 1]

Held in time in a world of tears, I slowly drown
Going home, I just can't make it all alone
I really should be holding you, holding you
Loving you, loving you

[Chorus]
Tragedy
When the feeling's gone, and you can't go on, It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're going nowhere

When you lose control, and you got no soul, it's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear
With no one beside you, you're going nowhere

Night and day, there's a burning down inside of me, aaah

425 - What a Fool Believes:The Doobie Brothers
[Verse 1]
He came from somewhere back in her long ago
The sentimental fool don't see
Tryin' hard to recreate
What had yet to be created once in her life
She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize it never really was

[Pre-Chorus]
She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

[Chorus]
But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
Than nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere
She will return
 [Pre-Chorus]
She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

[Chorus]
But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
(If love can come and love can go, then why can't love return once more?)
Is always better than nothing
(Who got the power?)
Than nothing at all (Oh, now)

What a fool believes
(I believe she's never gone away) he sees
No wise man has the power (To reason away)
To reason away
What seems to be
(Oh, if love can come and love can go, oh, mama)
Is always better than nothing (Better than nothing)
Than nothing at all (Oh, I believe)24

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

[Verse 2]
Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

In between, what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you do

430 - Love You Inside Out:Bee Gees
[Verse 1]
Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies don't gimme no rise
Oh, oh what you're trying to do?

Livin' on your cheatin'
And the pain grows inside me
It's enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever but you're
Driving me insane
And I'm hanging on
Oh, oh, I'll win, I'll never give in

Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
Ain't good for you
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right

I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
 What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in one
Lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm

Let this moment be forever
We won't ever feel the storm
I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out

I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Don't try to tell me it's all over
I can't hear a word I can't hear a line
No man could love you more
And that's what I'm cryin' for
You can't change the way I feel inside

You're the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand
Between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me
I will love you till I die
[Outro]
I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?1

Babe, I'm leaving
I'll say it once again
And somehow try to smile

And I'll need your love to see me through
Please believe me
My heart is in your hands
'Cause I'll be missing you

449 - It's Still Rock and Roll to Me:Billy Joel
[Verse 1]
What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
Welcome back to the age of jive

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy 'til you spend a lot of money

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

[Verse 2]
What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set of whitewall tires?
Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental

[Chorus]
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me
 [Bridge]
Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town but you can't get the sound
From a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen

[Verse 3]
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers

[Chorus]
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
Alright Richie!

[Saxophone Solo]
Woo!
Ooh
[Verse 4]
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
Don't you know that they're out of touch?
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
If you are then you think too much

[Pre-Chorus 4]
Don't you know about the new fashion, honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money

[Chorus]
It's the next phase, new wave
Dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me12

Just you wait and see

Just a dream and the wind to carry me

Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free6

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low

454 - Woman in Love:Barbra Streisand
[Verse 1]
Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone, it's a lonelier place
I kissed the morning goodbye
But down inside you know we never know why
The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes and the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall but I give you it all

[Chorus]
I am a woman in love and I'd do anything
To get you into my world and hold you within
It's a right I defend
Over and over again
What do I do?

[Verse 2]
With you eternally mine
In love there is no measure of time
We planned it all at the start
That you and I live in each other's heart
We may be oceans away
You feel my love, I hear what you say
No truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall but I give you it all
 [Chorus]
I am a woman in love and I'd do anything
To get you into my world and hold you within
It's a right I defend
Over and over again
What do I do?

[Chorus 2]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I am a woman in love and I'm talking to you
You know I know how you feel
What a woman can do
It's a right I defend
Over and over again

[Outro]
I am a woman in love and I'd do anything
To get you into my world and hold you within
It's a right I defend
Over and over again3

Our life together is so precious together
We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone

It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over (over)
Starting over (over)

[Verse 2]
Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy?
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by, my love
It'll be just like starting over (over)

Why don't we take off alone?
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together, all alone again
Like we used to in the early days

It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling

Starting over (over)
Look out!

We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special

459 - 9 to 5:Dolly Parton
[Verse 1]
Tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

[Chorus]
Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...

[Verse 2]
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way
 [Chorus]
Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet12

[Verse 1]
You should've seen by the look in my eyes, baby
There was something missing
You should've known by the tone of my voice, maybe
But you didn't listen
You played dead
But you never bled
Instead you lay still in the grass
All coiled up and hissing

[Verse 2]
And though I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us, baby, way before them
And we're still together

463 - Kiss on My List:Daryl Hall and John Oates
[Verse 1]
My friends wonder why I call you all the time, what can I say?
I don't feel the need to give such secrets away
You think maybe I need help, though I know I'm right, alright
I'm just better off not listening to friends' advice

[Pre-Chorus]
When they insist on knowing my bliss
I tell them this
When they wanna know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I tell them why

[Chorus]
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light

[Verse 2]
I go crazy wonderin' what there is to really see
Did the night just take up your time 'cause it means more to me
Sometimes I forget what I'm doing, I don't forget what I want, what I want
Regret what I've done, regret you? I couldn't go on
 [Pre-Chorus]
But if you insist on knowing my bliss
I'll tell you this
If you want to know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list

469 - Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do):Christopher Cross
[Verse 1]
Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way 'cross town
Wondering to yourself, "Hey, what've I found?"

[Chorus]
When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do
Is fall in love

[Verse 2]
Arthur, he does as he pleases
All of his life, his master's toys
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a pretty good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

[Chorus]
When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do (The best that you can do)
The best that you can do
Is fall in love
 [Saxophone Solo]

[Chorus (Repeat Until Fade-Out)]
When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true

The best that you can do
Is fall in love

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do (The best that you can do)
The best that you can do
Is fall in love

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true3

Who can it be knocking at my door?
Go 'way, don't come 'round here no more
Can't you see that it's late at night?
I'm very tired, and I'm not feeling right
All I wish is to be alone;
Stay away, don't you invade my home
Best off if you hang outside
Don't come in, I'll only run and hide

Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?

If he hears, he'll knock all day
I'll be trapped, and here I'll have to stay
I've done no harm, I keep to myself;
There's nothing wrong with my state of mental health
I like it here with my childhood friend;
Here they come, those feelings again!

Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?

That your fear seems to hide deep inside your mind
All alone, I have cried, silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel, made of stone

Well, I hear the music, close my eyes, feel the rhythm
Wrap around, take a hold of my heart

Take your passion, and make it happen
Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life

489 - Maniac:Michael Sembello
[Verse 1]
Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real-time world, no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy
Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

[Chorus 1]
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

[Verse 2]
On the ice-blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard-won place of mystery
Touch it, but can't hold it
You work all your life for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push-shove world, but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night
 [Pre-Chorus 2]
There's a cold kinetic heat
Struggling, stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind

[Chorus 2]
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

[Bridge]
Ooh, oh
Oh

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

[Chorus 2]
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
Maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before21

490 - Tell Her About It:Billy Joel
[Verse 1]
Listen boy I don't want to see you let a good thing slip away
You know I don't like watching anybody make the same mistakes I made

[Bridge 1]
She's a real nice girl and she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do

[Verse 2]
Oh, listen boy I'm sure that you think you got it all under control
You don't want somebody telling you the way to stay in someone's soul

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're a big boy now and you'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing she ought to know

[Chorus 1]
Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that you're for real
Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her, let her know how much she means

[Verse 3]
Listen boy it's not automatically a certain guarantee
To ensure yourself you've got to provide communication constantly
[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you love someone, you're always insecure
And there's only one good way to reassure

[Chorus 2]
Tell her about it, let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you, tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it, every day before you leave
Pay her some attention, give her something to believe

[Bridge 2]
Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken for so long
And though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone?

[Verse 4]
Listen boy it's good information from a man who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you could be the difference that it makes

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She's a trusting soul, she's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you what you should do

[Chorus 1]
Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that you're for real
Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her, let her know how much she means
 [Outro]
Tell her about it, tell her how you feel right now
Just tell her about it, the girl don't want to wait too long
You got to tell her about it, tell her now and you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it, before it gets too late
You've got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want to wait
You got to tell her about it
You got to tell, tell, tell her about it
Now, tell her about it5

Lyin' in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you picture me, I'm walkin' too far ahead
You're callin' to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, "Go slow", I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me

If you fall, I will catch you, (I'll be waiting) I will be waiting

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watchin' through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside

You've gone too far this time
But I'm dancing on the Valentine

With my chances on the danger line

Another day to make my stand, oh woah
High time is no time for deciding
If I should find a helping hand, oh woah

I'm on a ride, and I want to get off
But they won't slow down the roundabout
I sold the Renoir and TV set
Don't wanna be around when this gets out

Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it
Oh, why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it

The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark

Dig, if you will, the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling?
Can you picture this?

[Verse 2]
Dream, if you can, a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

[Chorus]
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
 [Verse 3]
Touch, if you will, my stomach (Hmm)
Feel how it trembles inside (Mhm)
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

[Chorus]
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
Doo-doo woah-oh
(Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (World that's so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding (Maybe, maybe)
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold (My father, you know he's cruel)
Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (Never, never satisfied, why scream?)
Why do we scream at each other? (Why?)
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
[Break]
When doves cry (When doves cry, when doves cry)
When doves cry (When doves cry, they cry)
Oh, no, oh
Oh, no, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
When doves cry
When doves cry (Hoo)
When doves cry (Hoo)
Baby, baby, baby, yeah

[Outro]
When doves cry (When doves cry, when doves cry)
Don't cry
Darling, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't, don't cry33

504 - What's Love Got to Do with It:Tina Turner
[Verse 1]
You must understand, oh, the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meetin' girl
Opposites attract

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that
Oh

[Chorus]
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

[Verse 2]
It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed, I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason, you do it for me
Oh
 [Chorus]
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
Ooh

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
I've been takin' on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way
Oh

[Chorus]
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
(What's love?) Got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a sweet old-fashioned notion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
[Outro]
(What's love got to do?) Ooh, got to do with it
(What's love but a second-hand emotion?)
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
(What's love?) Ooh, ooh
(Got to do with it) Got to do with it
(What's love?) But a second-hand emotion11

505 - Missing You:John Waite
[Intro]
Missing you, missing you
Missing you, missing you
Missing you, missing you
Missing you, missing you

[Verse 1]
Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left

[Verse 2]
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
 [Chorus]
I ain't missing you at all
(Missing you, missing you)
Since you've been gone away
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
No matter what I might say
(Missing you, missing you)

[Verse 3]
There's a message in the wire
And I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know
How desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world
I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

[Chorus]
I ain't missing you at all
(Missing you, missing you)
Since you've been gone away
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
No matter what my friends say
(Missing you, missing you)
[Bridge]
And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload

[Chorus]
I ain't missing you at all
(Missing you, missing you)
Since you've been gone away
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
No matter what my friends say
(Missing you, missing you)

I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
I keep lying to myself
(Missing you, missing you)

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
[Chorus]
I ain't missing you at all
(Missing you, missing you)
Since you've been gone away
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
No matter what my friends say

Ain't missing you
(Missing you)
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I keep lying to myself

I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
Ain't missing you

Oh no

No matter what my friends might say
I ain't missing you

506 - Let's Go Crazy:Prince and The Revolution
[Intro]
Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called "life"
Electric word, life
It means forever, and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else:
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-All-Right
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, babe
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor)
Whoo

[Verse 1]
If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see, I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
"Ah, ah," is all I heard
 [Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh no, let's go

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go

[Verse 2]
We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for? (What's it all for?)
You better live now
'Fore the grim reaper come knocking on your door

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh no, let's go

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go
[Bridge]
C'mon, baby
Let's get nuts
Yeah
(Crazy)
Let's go crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh no, let's go
Go (Go crazy)

[Bridge]
I said let's go crazy (Go crazy)
Let's go (Let's go)
Go (Let's go)

[Verse 3]
Dr. Everything'll-Be-All-Right
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough, children
He's coming
He's coming
Coming
[Guitar solo]

[Outro]
Take me away14

507 - I Just Called to Say I Love You:Stevie Wonder
[Verse 1]
No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact, here's just another ordinary day

[Verse 2]
No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, it's something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

[Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

[Verse 3]
No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

[Verse 4]
No Libra sun, no Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old, so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
 [Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
I just called to say I love you (Yeah)
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart
Baby, of my heart22

508 - Caribbean Queen (No More Love on the Run):Billy Ocean
[Intro]
She's simply awesome
Ooh

[Verse 1]
She dashed by me in painted on jeans
And all heads turned 'cause she was the dream
In the blink of an eye I knew her number and her name, yeah
She said I was the tiger she wanted to tame

[Chorus]
Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

[Verse 2]
I lose my cool when she steps in the room
And I get so excited just from her perfume
Electric eyes that you can't ignore
And passion burns you like never before

[Verse 3]
I was in search of a good time
Just running my game
Love was the furthest
Furthest from my mind
 [Chorus]
Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream

And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run
[Outro]
She is the queen
My Caribbean Queen
I said she dashed by me in painted jeans...5

510 - Out of Touch:Daryl Hall and John Oates
[Intro]
Hey, y'all, whoo!
I don't care if you got no legs!
Dance on your knees!
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (time)

[Verse 1]
Shake it up is all that we know
Using the bodies up as we go
I'm waking up to fantasy
The shades all around aren't the colors we used to see
Broken ice still melts in the sun
And times that are broken can often be one again
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Take a look around

[Chorus]
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
 [Verse 2]
Reaching out for something to hold
Looking for a love where the climate is cold
Manic moves and drowsy dreams
Or living in the middle between the two extremes
Smoking guns hot to the touch
Would cool down if we didn't
Use them so much, yeah
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Too much

[Chorus]
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Ooh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Interlude]
(Out of touch, out of touch
Out of touch, out of touch)
Wow!
[Chorus]
Ow, you're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch (We're soul alone, girl)
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
(Out of touch, out of time, out of touch, out of time, girl)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch (Reach out for something to hold)
Time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
(You're too cold, girl, too cold, girl, too cold, girl, yeah)
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
Not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
(Out of touch, out of time, out of touch, out of time)
(Out of touch, out of time, girl)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
Yeah, I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time...21

I've gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines

Through the clouds, I see love shine

514 - Can't Fight This Feeling:REO Speedwagon
[Verse 1]
Oh, I can't fight this feeling any longer
And yet, I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship, has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show
I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

[Pre-Chorus]
And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

[Chorus]
And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore
 [Verse 2]
My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running round in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places that, alone, I'd never find

[Pre-Chorus]
And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore5

And I know it's only words
But if you change your mind, you know that I'll be here
And maybe we both can learn

[Chorus]
Give me just one more night, give me just one more night
Ooh, one more night, 'cause I can't wait forever (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

But if you just believe, there's no way we can fall
Well, well, well
Let us realize, oh, that a change can only come
When we stand together as one (Yeah yeah yeah yeah!)

[Chorus: Choir]
We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day

517 - Crazy for You:Madonna
[Verse 1]
Swaying room, as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two, their bodies become one
I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare?
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

[Chorus]
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you

[Verse 2]
Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all
Slowly now, we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see
 [Chorus]
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
You'll feel it in my kiss
Because I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you

[Refrain]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh, woah

[Verse 1]
Won't you come see about me?
I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Giving me everything inside and out and
Love's strange, so real in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me

519 - Everything She Wants:Wham!
[Intro]
Uh, huh-huh
Oh yeah
Work

[Verse 1]
Somebody told me
"Boy, everything she wants, is everything she sees"
I guess I must have loved you
Because I said you were the perfect girl for me, maybe
And now we're six months older
And everything you want, and everything you see
Is out of reach, not good enough
I don't know what the hell you want from me, oh

[Verse 2]
Some people work for a living
Some people work for fun
Girl, I just work for you
They told me marriage was a give and take
Well, you've shown me you can take, you've got some giving to do
And now you tell me that you're having my baby
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
But one step further, and my back will break
If my best isn't good enough
Then how can it be good enough for two?

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo-doo-doo
I can't work any harder than I do (La, la, la, la-la)

Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo-doo-doo
La, la, la, la-la

[Chorus: George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley]
Somebody tell me, oh (Won't you tell me?)
Why I work so hard for you?
(Give you money) All to give you money, oh

Oh, why do, I do the things I do?
I'd tell you if I knew
My God, I don't even think that I love you (La, la, la, la-la)
Won't you tell me?
Give you money, work to give you money, oh
Work, work

523 - A View to a Kill:Duran Duran
[Verse 1]
Meeting you with a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places, feel the chill

Nightfall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making
Still overseas, could it be the whole Earth opening wide
A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside
A week is why, until we...

Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

[Verse 2]
The choice for you is the view to a kill
Between the shades assassination standing still

Earth's crystal tears, the fall of snowflakes on your body
First time in years to drench your skin in lover's rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die, but can we...
 [Chorus]
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

When all we see is the view to a kill11

526 - The Power of Love:Huey Lewis and the News
[Verse 1]
The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling; that's the power of love

Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good make a wrong one right
Power of love that keeps you home at night

[Chorus]
You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love
That's the power of love

[Verse 3]
First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it, it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found
That's the power makes the world go'round

And it don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

[Bridge]
They say that all in love is fair
Yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Can you feel it?
Hmmm

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
It don't take money and it don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
You won't feel nothin' till you feel
You feel the power, just feel the power of love
That's the power, that's the power of love
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Feel the power of love4

Movin' straight ahead, you knew it all
But maybe sometime if you feel the pain
You'll find you're all alone, everything has changed

[Verse 2]

You've got your family and they need you there
Though I try to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

Love gives you the right to be free
You said, "Be patient, just wait a little longer."
But that's just an old fantasy

Just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling
When you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for a feeling alright

[Verse 1: Stevie Wonder]
Call up, ring once, hang up the phone
To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover
If she's with me, I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you, my part-time lover

[Chorus]
We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

[Verse 2]
If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word's "discreet" with part-time lovers
But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek it's really you my part-time lover

Last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you, my part-time lover

You and me, part-time lovers
But, she and he, part-time lovers

We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

[Verse 1]
Say you don't know me
Or recognize my face
Say you don't care who goes
To that kind of place
Knee deep in the hoopla
Sinking in your fight
Too many runaways
Eating up the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

[Chorus]
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
 [Verse 2]
Someone always playing
Corporation games
Who cares they're always changing
Corporation names
We just want to dance here
Someone stole the stage
They call us irresponsible
Write us off the page

[Pre-Chorus]
Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

[Chorus]
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

[Verse 3]
It's just another Sunday
In a tired old street
Police have got the choke hold, oh
And we just lost the beat
Who counts the money
Underneath the bar
Who rides the wrecking ball
Into our guitars
Don't tell us you need us
'Cause we're the ship of fools
Looking for America
Coming through your schools
[Bridge]
I'm looking out over that Golden Gate bridge
On another gorgeous sunny Saturday
And I'm seeing that bumper to bumper traffic
Don't you remember? ('Member, 'member)
It's your favorite radio station
In your favorite radio city
The city by the bay, the city that rocks
The city that never sleeps

[Pre-Chorus]
Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

[Chorus]
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city (Oo-ho)
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
[Outro]
We built, we built this city, yeah

533 - Separate Lives:Phil Collins and Marilyn Martin
[Verse 1]
You called me from the room in your hotel
All full of romance for someone that you met
And telling me how sorry you were, leaving so soon
And that you miss me sometimes when you're alone in your room
Do I feel lonely too?

[Chorus]
You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me, so kind
I can't go on just holding on to ties
Now that we're living separate lives

[Verse 2]
Well, I held on to let you go
And if you lost your love for me, well you never let it show
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living (living)
Separate lives

[Bridge]
Ooh, it's so typical, love leads to isolation
So you build that wall (build that wall)
Yes, you build that wall (build that wall)
And you make it stronger
 [Chorus]
You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me, so kind
I can't go on just holding on to ties
Now that we're living separate lives2

534 - Broken Wings:Mr. Mister

Why we can't just hold on to each other's hands?
This time might be the last I fear unless
I make it all too clear I need you so, ohh

[Chorus]
Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings

[Verse 2]
Baby, I think tonight
We can take what was wrong and make it right
Baby, it's all I know that you're half of the flesh
And blood that makes me whole, I need you so

[Chorus]
So take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings
You've got to learn to fly, learn to live, love so free
When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Yeah, yeah

Let us in
Let us in

[Chorus Intro]
Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

I had a dream, I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out

Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

You've got someone there to say
I'll show you

Say you, say me
Say it for always, (Oh) that's the way it should be
Say you, say me

Say you, say me
Say it for always, (Oh) that's the way it should be

The wind blows hard against this mountain side
Across the sea into my soul
It reaches into where I cannot hide
Setting my feet upon the road

My heart is old, it holds my memories
My body burns a gemlike flame
Somewhere between the soul and soft machine
Is where I find myself again

Kyrie eleison, through the darkness of the night
Kyrie eleison, where I'm going, will you follow?
Kyrie eleison, on a highway in the light

Of what my life would mean to me
Would I have followed down my chosen road
Or only wished what I could be

542 - Addicted to Love:Robert Palmer
[Verse 1]
The lights are on, but you're not home
Your mind is not your own
Your heart sweats, your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes

You can't sleep, you can't eat
There's no doubt, you're in deep
Your throat is tight, you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need

You know you're going to have to face it, you're addicted to love

You see the signs, but you can't read
You're running at a different speed

If there's some left for you
You don't mind if you do

543 - West End Girls:Pet Shop Boys
[Verse 1: Neil Tennant]
Sometimes you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand, and it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad, too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant in a West End town
Call the police, there's a madman around
Running down underground to a dive bar
In a West End town

[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
West End girls

[Verse 2: Neil Tennant & Helena Springs]
Too many shadows, whispering voices
Faces on posters, too many choices
If, when, why, what?
How much have you got?
Have you got it, do you get it, if so, how often?
And which do you choose, a hard or soft option?
(How much do you need?)
 [Chorus: Neil Tennant]
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
West End girls
West End girls

In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
Ooh, West End town, a dead end world
East End boys, West End Girls
West End girls

[Verse 3: Neil Tennant & Helena Springs]
You've got a heart of glass or a heart of stone
Just you wait 'til I get you home
We've got no future, we've got no past
Here today, built to last
In every city, in every nation
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station
(How far have you been?)
[Chorus: Neil Tennant & Helena Springs]
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
A West End town, a dead end world
East End Boys, West End girls
West End girls
West End girls

(How far have you been?)

544 - Greatest Love of All:Whitney Houston
[Verse 1]
I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

[Pre-Chorus]
I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

[Chorus]
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all
 [Verse 2]
I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

[Chorus]
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

[Outro]
And if, by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love15

545 - Live to Tell:Madonna
[Verse 1]
I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Verse 2]
I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Post-Chorus]
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?
 [Bridge]
If I ran away, I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?
How will they hear? When will they learn? How will they know?

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Post-Chorus]
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me6

I'd be lying here beside you

This wasn't how it was supposed to end
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again
On my own
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone
By myself
On my own
I've got to find out where I belong again
I've got to learn to be strong again
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone
By myself, by myself, by myself
I've got to find out what was mine again
My heart is saying that it's time again
And I have faith that I will shine again
By myself
I have faith in me
Oh
I know I'll make it
By myself, by myself1

Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say

Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames

Take it to the good times
See it through the bad times
Whatever it takes is what I'm gonna do
 [Pre-Chorus: Grace Slick]

What do they know?
Put your arms around me
Baby, don't ever let go
Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us

All that I ever need
And all that I want to do
Is hold you forever and ever and ever, hey

And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us, woah
[Chorus: Both & Grace Slick]
And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
(Nothing's gonna stop us now)
If this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
(Oh, no)

572 - (I Just) Died in Your Arms:Cutting Crew
[Intro]
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

[Verse 1]
I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary, it sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

[Chorus]
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
[Verse 2]
Is there any just 'cause for feeling like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times
 [Chorus]
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
[Bridge]
It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over the moment has gone
I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away26

573 - With or Without You:U2
[Verse 1]
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side

Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I'll wait without you

[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you

Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

I can't live
With or without you

[Refrain]
And you give yourself away

My body bruised
She got me with
Nothing to win and nothing left to lose

[Refrain]
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give

With or without you

578 - Alone:Heart
[Verse 1]
I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here, the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh, I hope that it won't end though
Alone

[Chorus]
'Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

[Verse 2]
You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh
You don't know how long I have waited
And I was gonna tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone

'Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

580 - I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For:U2
[Verse 1]
I have climbed highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

[Chorus]
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

[Verse 2]
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone
 [Chorus]
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still running
You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believe it

[Chorus]
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

583 - Didn't We Almost Have It All:Whitney Houston
[Verse 1]
Remember when we held on in the rain
The nights we almost lost it
Once again, we can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you, I feel it all again

[Chorus]
Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all?
The nights we hold on 'til the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all?

[Verse 2]
The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again

[Chorus]
Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all?
The night we hold on 'til the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all?
 [Bridge]
Didn't we have the best of times
When love was young and new?
Couldn't we reach inside and find
The world of me and you?
We'll never lose it again
Because once you know what love is
You never let it end

[Chorus]
Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all?
The night we hold on 'til the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all?
Didn't we almost have it all?2

I don't know where I'm going
But, I sure know where I've been
Hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time
Though I keep searching for an answer
I never seem to find what I'm looking for
Oh Lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

Going down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

Waiting on love's sweet charity
An' I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days

Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

I ain't wasting no more time

Here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go

And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

To walk along the lonely street of dreams

Going down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

Stay with me tonight

591 - Faith:George Michael
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Well, I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
I know not everybody has got a body like you
But I gotta think twice before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play because I played them too

Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, when that love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man, baby
But I'm showin' you the door

[Chorus]
'Cause I gotta' have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I got to have faith, faith, faith

[Verse 2]
Baby, I know you're askin' me to stay
Say, "Please, please, please don't go away"
You say I'm givin' you the blues
Maybe (Huh) you mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules
 [Pre-Chorus]
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh, baby, I reconsider my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for somethin' more

Ooh, I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith

And the only things I learned
Is that I need you desperately

Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me
Ooh, baby

I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold

You're always on my mind

Time keeps dragging on and on

I'll play your game
You hurt me through and through
But you can have your way

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care
And I don't need you
And though you'll never see me crying
You know inside I feel like dying

And I'd do anything for you
In spite of it all
I've learned so much from you
You made me strong

But don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye
 I hope you find someone to please you
Someone who'll care and never leave you
But if that someone ever hurts you
You just might need a friend to turn to

And I'd do anything for you
I'll give you up
If that's what I should do
To make you happy

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though inside I feel like dying
You know you'll never see me crying

Don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye1

604 - One More Try:George Michael
[Verse 1]
I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm lookin' out for angels
Just tryin' to find some peace
Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you don't, just let me go

[Chorus]
'Cause teacher, there are things
That I don't wanna learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't wanna learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 2]
When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Tellin' me "No"
So you think that you love me and know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong, just let me go
 [Chorus]
And teacher, there are things
That I don't wanna learn
Oh, the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't wanna learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]
So when you say that you need me, that you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong, let me go

[Chorus]
And teacher, there are things
That I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh, so I don't wanna learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Who just isn't willin' to try

[Outro]
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more try7

605 - Together Forever:Rick Astley
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
If there's anything you need
All you have to do is say
You know you satisfy everything in me
We shouldn't waste a single day

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So don't stop me falling, it's destiny calling
A power I just can't deny
It's never changing, can't you hear me, I'm saying

Together forever and never to part
Together forever we're two
And don't you know I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you?

If they ever get you down
There's always something I can do
Because I wouldn't ever wanna see you frown
I'll always do what's best for you

Something to last for all time

Together forever we're two
And don't you know I would move heaven and earth

To be together forever with you?
Together forever and never to part
Together forever we're two
And don't you know I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you?8

606 - Foolish Beat:Debbie Gibson
[Verse 1]
There was a time when
Broken hearts and broken dreams
Were over
There was a place where
All you could do was
Wish on a four leaf clover

But now is a new time
There is a new place
Where dreams just can't come true
It started the day when I left you

[Chorus]
I could never love again the way that I loved you
I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart
(Without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart

[Verse 2]
When I was sorry
It was too late to turn around
And tell you so
There was no reason
There was no reason
Just a foolish beat of my heart
 [Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh, can't you see I'm not fooling nobody
Don't you see the tears are falling down my face?
Since you went away
Break my heart, you slipped away
Didn't know I was wrong
Never meant to hurt you now you're gone

I could never love again now that we're apart
(Now that we're apart)
I could never love again now that we're apart1

607 - Dirty Diana:Michael Jackson
[Verse 1]
You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time, you won't seduce me

[Pre-Chorus]
She's saying "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says "There's no turning back"
She trapped me in her heart

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no, oh no, oh no
 [Verse 2]
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

[Pre-Chorus]
She's saying "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star"

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
[Interlude]
Diana
Diana
Dirty Diana
It's Diana, -iana, -iana
C'mon!

[Verse 3]
She said "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright"

[Pre-Chorus]
Diana walked up to me
She said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that, I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright"
I said "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key"
She said "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me"
[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

[Outro]

608 - The Flame:Cheap Trick
[Verse 1]
Another night slowly closes in
And I feel so lonely
Touching heat freezing on my skin
I pretend you still hold me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep
I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you
I can't believe you're gone
You were the first, you'll be the last

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone
To lay your heart and head upon
Remember after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame

[Verse 2]
Watching shadows move across the wall
Feels so frightening
I wanna run to you, I wanna call
But I've been hit by lightning
 [Pre-Chorus]
Just can't stand up for fallin' apart
Can't see through this veil across my heart over you
You'll always be the one
You were the first, you'll be the last

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone
To lay your heart and head upon
Remember after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame

[Guitar Solo]

Whatever you want, I'll give it to you

Wherever you go, I'll be with you
And whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Oh, whatever you want, I'll give it to you1

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?

Now it's time I had the best

Back, then, then, back, then, then
Back, back (do it again)

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried my best

So I guess that I don't want you anymore
Well you say you care about me
That you just can't do without me
But you keep on dancin' baby
'Til that monkey has you on the floor

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?

612 - Sweet Child o' Mine:Guns N' Roses
[Instrumental Intro/Guitar Riff]

[Verse 1]
She's got a smile that it seems, to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then, when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

[Chorus]
Woah-woah-woah
Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet love of mine
[Post-Chorus Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
 [Chorus]
Woah-oh-woah
Sweet child of mine
Ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet love of mine
[Post-Chorus Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet child of mine, ooh, yeah-eh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Sweet love of mine

Mm-huh, where do we go now?
Ah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-oh (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
Ooh, where do we go now? (Where do we go?)
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-oh, wow
Where do we go?
Oh-oh, where do we go now?
(Oh) Where do we go, oh-oh-oh-oh? (Oh, wow)
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Woah-oh, where do we go now?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

613 - Don't Worry, Be Happy:Bobby McFerrin
[Verse 1]
Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

[Chorus]
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

[Verse 2]
Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry, be happy (Look at me, I'm happy)

[Chorus]
Don't worry, be happy
(Hey I'll give you my phone number, when you worry call me I'll make you happy!)
Don't worry, be happy
 [Verse 3]
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you worry your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

[Chorus]
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

[Bridge]
Now there is the song I wrote
I hope you learned it note for note, like good little children
Don't worry, be happy
Now listen to what I said, in your life expect some trouble
When you worry you make it double
But don't worry, be happy, be happy now

[Chorus]
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
(Don't worry, don't worry, don't do it, be happy
Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like this
Don't worry, it will soon pass whatever it is)
Don't worry, be happy
I'm not worried
I'm happy24

[Intro]
If you've got love in your sights
Watch out
Love bites

[Verse 1]
When you make love, do you look in the mirror?
Who do you think of, does he look like me?
Do you tell lies? And say that it's forever
Do you think twice, or just touch and see?
Ooh, babe
Oh, yeah
When you're alone, do you let go?
Are you wild and willing or is it just for show?
Ooh, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it
No

[Chorus]
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need
 [Verse 2]
When I'm with you, are you somewhere else?
Am I getting through or do you please yourself?
When you wake up, will you walk out?
It can't be love if you throw it about
Ooh, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
Oh

[Intro]
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take ya
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Jamaica

[Verse 1]
Off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo

To get away from it all
Bodies in the sand
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego

That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo
 Martinique, that Montserrat mystique

We'll put out to sea
We'll perfect our chemistry
By and by we'll defy
A little bit of gravity
Afternoon delight
Cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye
Give me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo

[Chorus]
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo
Port au Prince, I want to catch a glimpse
[Verse 3]
Everybody knows
A little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go
To get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo

[Chorus]
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Ooh I wanna take you down to...12

619 - Bad Medicine:Bon Jovi
[Chorus]
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad medicine)

[Verse 1]
I ain't got a fever got a permanent disease
It'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms count them, one, two, three

[Pre-Chorus]
First you need (That's what you get for falling in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little but it's never enough)
On your knees (That's what you get for falling in love)
And now this boy's addicted cause your kiss is the drug

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad, bad medicine)
 [Verse 2]
I don't need no needle to be giving me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addiction, it doesn't leave a track
I've got a jones for your affection like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack

[Pre-Chorus]
When you need (That's what you get for falling in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little but it's never enough)
On your knees (That's what you get for falling in love)
Now this boy is addicted and your kiss is the drug

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
So let's play doctor, baby, cure my disease
(Bad, bad medicine) That's what I want
(Bad, bad medicine) That's what I need

[Verse 3]
I need a respirator cause I'm running out of breath
You're an all night generator wrapped in stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine you take what you can get
'Cause if there's something better baby well they haven't found it yet
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
Your love, bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
Your love's the potion that can cure my disease
Bad, bad medicine is what I want
Bad, bad medicine (I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta)

[Breakdown]
I gotta, I gotta
I gotta do it again, wait a minute, wait a minute
Hold on
I'm not done
One more time
With feeling
Come on
Help me out now

[Chorus]
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up just like bad medicine
You got the potion that can cure my disease
Your love, bad medicine
Your kiss is what I need
Your love, bad medicine8

620 - Look Away:Chicago
[Verse 1: Bill Champlin]
When you called me up this morning
Told me about the new love you found
I said "I'm happy for you
I'm really happy for you"
Found someone else
I guess I won't be coming around
I guess it's over, baby
It's really over, baby, whoa...
And from what you saying
I know you've gotten over me
It'll never be the way it used to be
So if it's got to be this way
Don't worry, baby, I can take the news okay

[Chorus: Bill Champlin, with bandmates]
But if you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
If we meet on the streets someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

[Verse 2: Bill Champlin]
When we both agreed as lovers
We were better off as friends
That's how it had to be
Yeah, that's how it had to be
I tell you I'm fine
But sometimes I just pretend
Wish you were holding me
Wish you were still holding me, whoa...
I just never thought
That I would be replaced so soon
I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you
I know I wanted to be free
Yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be
 [Chorus: Bill Champlin, with bandmates]
But if you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
If we meet on the streets someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Bill Champlin, with bandmates]
If you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
If we meet on the streets someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me
If you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me
[Outro: Bill Champlin]
When you called me up this morning
Told me about the new love you found
I said "I'm happy for you
I'm really happy for you"2

621 - Every Rose Has Its Thorn:Poison
[Verse 1]
We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did?
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you, though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn, yeah, it does

[Verse 2]
I listen to our favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say, "Love's a game of easy come
And easy go"
But I wonder, does he know?
Has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow, I guess
 [Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

[Bridge]
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

[Verse 3]
I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of making love
We both made our separate ways
And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife, I guess

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn17

That's my prerogative

[Verse 1]
They say I'm crazy, I really don't care

What is this, a blizzard, that I can't have money in my pocket
And people not talk about me?
This world is a trip; I don't know what's goin' on these days
Got this person over here talkin' about me, this person
Ay, listen, let me tell you somethin', it's my prerogative

623 - Two Hearts:Phil Collins
[Verse 1]
Well, there was no reason to believe she'd always be there
But if you don't put faith in what you believe in
It's getting you nowhere
Cause it hurts, you never let go
Don't look down, just look up
Cause she's always there behind you, just to remind you

[Chorus]
Two hearts, believing in just one mind
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind

[Verse 2]
Cause there's no easy way to, to understand it
There's so much of my life in her, and it's like I'm blinded
And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you no matter how far
Wherever you are

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

Beating together till the end of time

You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind

If you are all that you seem

626 - Lost in Your Eyes:Debbie Gibson
[Verse 1]
I get lost in your eyes
And I feel my spirits rise
And soar like the wind
Is it love that I am in?

[Verse 2]
I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
And now I know
'Cause when I'm lost, I can let go

[Chorus]
I don't mind not knowing
What I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in Heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

[Verse 3]
I just fell, don't know why
Something's there we can't deny
And when I first knew
Was when I first looked at you

[Verse 4]
And if I can't find my way
If salvation seems worlds away
Ooh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes, woah-oh-oh
 [Chorus]
I don't mind not knowing
What I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in Heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

Isn't this what's called romance?
Ooh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes

627 - The Living Years:Mike + The Mechanics
[Verse 1]
Every generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door

I know that I'm a prisoner to all my father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage, to all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years

Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got

You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defence

[Chorus]
Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye
 [Verse 2]
So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts

So don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different day
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be okay

[Chorus]
Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye

[Verse 3]
I wasn't there that morning
When my father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say
I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him
In the living years

[Chorus]
Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye2

629 - She Drives Me Crazy:Fine Young Cannibals
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can't stop the way I feel
Things you do don't seem real
Tell me what you've got in mind
'Cause we're running out of time
Won't you ever set me free?
This waiting 'round's killing me

[Chorus]
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

[Verse 2]
I can't get any rest
People say I'm obsessed
Everything you say is lies
But to me, there's no surprise
What I had for you was true
Things go wrong, they always do

[Chorus]
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
 [Verse 3]
I won't make it on my own
No one likes to be alone

[Chorus]
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself3

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (Oh, yeah)
It's like a dream to me (Oh, oh)

Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there
Just like a prayer

631 - I'll Be There for You:Bon Jovi
[Verse 1]
I guess this time you're really leavin'
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well as my broken heart lies bleedin'
You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimmin' for the shore
You left me drownin' in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I'm prayin' to God you'll give me one more chance, girl

[Chorus]
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you

[Verse 2]
I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hidin' place
Well, I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday

But I wanted to be your valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine
 [Chorus]
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And I wasn't there when you were happy
(And I wasn't there to make you happy)
I wasn't there when you were down
I didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out

[Chorus]
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you

634 - Wind Beneath My Wings:Bette Midler
[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind

[Verse 2]
So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

[Chorus]
Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

[Verse 2]
It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know, I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you
 [Chorus 2]
Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

[Bridge]
Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away, you let me fly so high
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings

[Outro]
Fly, fly, so high against the sky
So high I almost touch the sky
Thank you, thank you
Thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings3

All the things, that we've been through
You should understand me like I understand you

What good is a love affair when we can't see eye to eye

[Intro]
Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
It wasn't my intention to mislead you
It never should have been this way
What can I say?
It's true
I did extend the invitation
I never knew how long you'd stay
When you hear temptation call
It's your heart that takes
Takes the fall
(Won't you come out and play with me?)

[Chorus]
Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers
 Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
It's getting hard to wake up in the morning
My head is spinning constantly
How can it be?
How could I be so blind to this addiction?
If I don't stop
The next one's gonna be me
Only emptiness remains
It replaces all
All the pain
(Won't you come out and play with me?)

[Chorus]
Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers

Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

Only emptiness remains
It replaces all
All the pain
(Won't you come out and play with me?)

We all fall down
Like toy soldiers

Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down (all fall down, all fall down)
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win

Look into his eyes, uh-oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules, uh-oh
Girl, don't play the fool, no

[Verse 1]
You're the one givin' up the love

Anything to please him
Do you really think he thinks about you when he's out?

Sometimes it's hard to make things clear
Or know when to face the truth
And I know that the moment is here

I am only myself, myself

When you're all that I know
And I know that

646 - Girl I'm Gonna Miss You:Milli Vanilli
I knew it from the start you would break my heart
But still I had to play this painful part
You wrapped me round your little bitty finger
With your magic smile

You kept me hangin' on a lover's cross awhile
You put your spell on me, took my breath away
But there was nothin' I could do to make you stay
I'm gonna miss you

All the love I feel for you
Nothing could make me change my point of view
Oh girl, I'm gonna miss you, baby

Givin' all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leavin'
Now I'm sittin' here wastin' my time
I just don't know what I should do

It's a tragedy for me to see the dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl, I'm gonna miss you

Like a honey bee, you took the best of me
Now I can't erase those memories
Like a fairy tale, you were so unreal
You left a scar that's so hard to heal
 When you had a taste of paradise
Back on Earth can feel as cold as ice
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
I miss you

Givin' all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leavin'

It makes my body hot

652 - Another Day in Paradise:Phil Collins
[Verse 1]
She calls out to the man on the street
"Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?"
He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

[Chorus]
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise

[Interlude]
Think about it

[Verse 2]
She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk, but she's trying

[Chorus]
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise
 [Interlude]
Just think about it

[Bridge]
Oh, Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh, Lord, there must be something you can say

[Verse 3]
You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there

653 - How Am I Supposed to Live Without You:Michael Bolton
[Verse 1]
I could hardly believe it, when I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leavin', someone's swept your heart away
From the look upon your face, I see it's true

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'
Oh, then tell me one thing more before I go

[Chorus]
Tell me, how am I supposed to live without you?
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on?
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

[Verse 2]
I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you when I built my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming, oh
Even now, it's more than I can take
 [Chorus]
Tell me, how am I supposed to live without you?
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on?
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Now, I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Oh, now that your dream has come true

[Chorus]
Tell me, how am I supposed to live without you?
Now that I've been lovin' you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on?
When all that I've been livin' for is gone8

[Verse 1: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
Baby, it seems we never ever agree
You like the movies and I like TV
I take things serious and you take 'em light
I go to bed early and I party all night
Our friends are saying we ain't gonna last
'Cause I move slowly and baby, I'm fast
I like it quiet and I love to shout
But when we get together, it just all works out

She makes the bed and he steals the covers
She likes it neat and he makes a mess

I don't like cigarettes and I like to smoke
Things in common? There just ain't a one!
But when we get together, we have nothin' but fun

I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract

659 - Nothing Compares 2 U:Sinead O'Connor
[Verse 1]
It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing, I said, nothing can take away these blues

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

[Verse 2]
It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me
He said, "Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do," but he's a fool

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
 [Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the backyard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

[Outro]
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you20

Must have been love
But it's over now

[Verse 1]
Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely
This air of silence
In the bedroom and all around (All around)
Touch me now
I close my eyes
And dream away

But I lost it somehow
It must have been love

Make believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside
I turn to water
Like a teardrop in your palm
And it's a hard
Winter's day
I dream away

664 - She Ain't Worth It:Glenn Medeiros featuring Bobby Brown
[Intro: Bobby Brown]
Better make tracks
Fast on the double
The girl's jazzy
But she's nothing but trouble

[Verse 1: Glenn Medeiros]
You take her where she wants to go
And every day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind

But she just got an attitude
Leads you on
Then leaves you blue
Can't you see
She's really just a waste of time

One day
She'll treat you nice
Then she turn as cold as ice
But you think
Your love will win her in the end
Think again

[Chorus:]
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief
That she's been putting you through
Ooh
 She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me
I know
I know better than
Better than, better than
Bet, bet better than you

[Verse 2: Glenn Medeiros]
She gets you hot
Then leaves you cold
Keeps you waiting on the phone
Cause she knows
You'll always give her one more try

You're not the only boy in town
And she loves playing to the crowd
But tell me
Do you really like standing in line?

You give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends
She did it again
[Repeat Chorus:]

[Glenn Medeiros:]
I'd like to say she used to be my girl
But that would be a lie
(That would be a lie)

Cause there's no one
In this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied I know
Cause I tried

[Rap: Bobby Brown]
Jump in
One thing I hate
Is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
Cause I've tried to make you mine

For the last time
So take this here as a dis
And a goodbye

She ain't worth it
Even though she's on the high tip
She better get a grip
And get a grip quick
Fast in a hurry
Cause I won't buckle
The girl's jazzy
But she's nothing but trouble

[Bridge: Glenn Medeiros]
Give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends
She did it again

[Repeat Chorus 3x:]1

665 - Vision of Love:Mariah Carey
[Verse 1]
Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

[Chorus]
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

[Verse 2]
Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

[Chorus]
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me
 [Bridge]
I've realized the dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

[Verse 3]
You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

[Chorus]
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be18

667 - Blaze Of Glory:Jon Bon Jovi
[Verse 1]
I wake up in the morning and I raise my weary head
I've got an old coat for a pillow, and the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm goin', only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run, a six gun lover, a candle in the wind

[Verse 2]
When you're brought into this world, they say you're born in sin
Well, at least they gave me somethin', I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well, they tell me that I'm wanted, yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable, I'm what Cain was to Abel, Mr. Catch-Me-If-You-Can

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
And, Lord, I never drew first, but I drew first blood
I'm no one's son, call me young gun

[Verse 3]
You ask about my conscience and I offer you my soul
You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man, well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come, I've seen it shot down, I've seen it die in vain

[Chorus]
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son, call me young gun
 [Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Each night I go to bed, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No, I ain't lookin' for forgiveness, but before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I gotta ask a favor, and I'll hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest, let this boy die like a man
Starin' down a bullet, let me make my final stand

[Chorus]
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
And I'm no one's son, call me young gun
I'm a young gun
Young gun
Young gun1

(Here she comes) Mmm, just like an angel
Seems like forever that she's been on my mind
But nothing has changed
She thinks I'm a waste of her time

(There she goes) she don't know what she's missing
Can't she see I'll never give up the fight
I'll do all I can
Till she understands my desire

I've been on the outside looking in
Let me into your heart, oh
There's nothing on earth that should keep us apart
Baby

I can't live without your love and affection
I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone
'Cause I can't live without your love
Mmm, your love

(So I wait) Here for an answer
And wonder if tomorrow will be like yesterday
I'll keep holding on
Can't go on living this way, baby
 I've been on the outside looking in
Bring my tears to an end, oh
I realize there's no use for me to pretend
Oh yeah

I can't live without your love and affection
I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone
'Cause I can't live without your love

(For your love) I'd put my arms around you
(For your love) I'd find the strength to tell you
(For your love) That I can't live without your

I can't live without your love and affection
I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone
Baby

I can't live without your love and affection
I just can't go on this way anymore
As hard as I try there's one thing that I know for sure
I can't live without your love

(There she goes)
I can't live without your love, baby
(There she goes)
Oh, I can't live without your love
(There she goes)
Oh, I can't live without your love1

671 - Praying for Time:George Michael
These are the days of the open hand, they will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance and legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor, and most of us are not sure
If we have too much, but we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way, he must have let us all out to play
Turned his back, and all God's children crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much, much too late
Well, maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand, oh, you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year
This is the year of the guilty man, your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say "What's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much, but I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score."
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
'Cause he has no children to come back for?
 It's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
So, maybe we should all be praying for time5

673 - Black Cat:Janet Jackson
[Verse 1]
All the lonely nights, I spend alone
Never around to love me, you're always gone
'Cause you're hanging out, breaking the rules
Oh, the man has come looking for you
You're a rebel now, don't give a damn
Always carrying on with the gang
I'm trying to tell you, boy, it's a mistake
You won't realize 'til it's too late

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

[Chorus]
Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Living on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die

[Verse 2]
You're so together, boy, but just at a glance
You'll do anything if given a chance
Scheming, planning lies to get what you need
So full of promises that you never keep
Don't you tell yourself that it's okay
Sick and tired of all of your games
And you want me to stay, ah, better change
Makes no sense to me, your crazy ways
 [Pre-Chorus]
Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

[Bridge]
Not afraid to die
Black cat, black cat
Man, I don't understand your ways
Living on the edge

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

[Chorus]
Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Living on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die
Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Living on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die
Black cat, living' on the
Heartbeat, better watch your step4

675 - Love Takes Time:Mariah Carey
[Verse 1]
I had it all
But I let it slip away
Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone

[Chorus]
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

[Verse 2]
Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete
Lord I'm need you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly
 [Chorus]
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

[Bridge]
You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do and I feel that you do
Inside

[Chorus]
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was so blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be there alone8

So I decided to write you this song
And just to let you know exactly the way I feel
And let you know my love's for real

I'll give you my heart, my everything

And that you're starting to lose ground

For you to justify my love
Hoping, praying
For you to justify my love

On the permission of another

679 - Love Will Never Do (Without You):Janet Jackson
[Verse 1]
Our friends think we're opposites
Falling in and out of love
They've all said we'd never last
Still we manage to stay together

[Verse 2]
There's no easy explanation for it
But whenever there's a problem
We always work it out somehow
Work it out somehow

(We had to prove them wrong)
(Cause I've learned in the past)

To replace you as my lover
Never did I have a doubt

Has quite the same, ooh ooh

Tryna get a nut to move your butt
To the dance floor, so yo what's up
Hands in the air, come on, say "Yeah"

Party people in the house, move

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I used to cry myself to sleep at night
But that was all before he came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now he's here
It's not the same, it's not the same

[Chorus]
He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

And in the morning when I kiss his eyes
He takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
He holds me close and won't let go
He won't let go

He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world

683 - Someday:Mariah Carey
[Verse 1]
You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself "I just don't need her now"
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other

[Chorus]
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause, baby, I'm the one who's keeping score

[Verse 2]
You'll change your mind and call my name
As soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying, you shoulda have known
Believe me, I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
Because I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others
 [Chorus]
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

[Bridge]
Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me, the one and only?
But when your down in your time in need
And you're thinking how you might be coming back to own me
Just think again because I won't need your love anymore

[Chorus]
Someday
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, someday
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey

The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey

[Verse 1]
Once again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby, look what we've become
We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain

[Chorus]
I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry

[Verse 2]
Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone
Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around
 [Chorus]
I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry, no no

[Bridge]
All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make-believing
On make-believing

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
Said I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
[Outro]
Cry...
I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna...
Cry...7

701 - When A Man Loves A Woman:Michael Bolton
When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world
For the good thing he's found

If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on
To what he needs

He'd give up all his comforts
Sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It oughta be, hey

When a man loves a woman, hey
I give you everything I've got
Trying to hold on to your precious love
Baby, baby please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him
Such misery
 If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes
Can never see

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
Cause, baby, baby

When a man loves a woman, oh
When a man loves a woman, yeah
When a man loves a woman
When a man, when a man, when a man loves a woman
Ooh5

Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight, hee!
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're Black or White, ooh!

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell 'em
I ain't second to none

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right, ooh!
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're Black or White, ooh!
 [Break: Michael Jackson]
Gone withca girl!
Hee-hee!

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Oh, when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

[Verse 3: L.T.B.]
Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye, hee-hee!
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're Black or White

I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're Black or White
I said if you're thinking of being my brother

I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

[Verse 2: George Michael]
It's much too late to save myself from fallin'
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

[Chorus: George Michael]
Don't let the sun go down on me, yeah
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, oh

Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John

[Verse 3: Elton John, George Michael, & both]
I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me (Baby, no)

(Just because you think I mean you harm, no)
But these cuts I have (Cuts I have)
They need love (They need love, they need love)
To help them heal, oh
 [Chorus: Elton John, George Michael, & both]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, oh

[Chorus: Elton John, George Michael, & both]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else that I see, yeah
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, baby, oh
'Cause losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon

Sometimes it's all a big surprise

Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

When some silly girl had set you free

And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say

Because life is short, and before you know, you're feeling old
And your heart is breaking, don't hold on to the past
Well, that's too much to ask

This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say

No regrets, but I wish that you were here with me
Well, then there's hope yet, I can see your face In our secret place
You're not just a memory, say goodbye to yesterday
Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say)

This used to be my playground (Used to be)
This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to

This used to be the place we ran to
I wish you were standing here with me
This used to be our playground (Used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
The best things in life are always free
Wishing you were here with me1

Although we've come to the end of the road (We've come to the end of the road)

Come to the end of the road (I don't know what I'm gonna do 'cause I know I've come to the end of the road, the end of the road)
Still, I can't let go (Oh my God, oh my God, help me out a little bit, baby)
It's unnatural (Baby), you belong to me (Baby), I belong to you (Baby)
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still, I can't let go (Alright, alright, alright)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you (It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you, woah)
Come to the end of the road (Although we've come to the end of the road)
Still, I can't let go (I know I just can't let go, no)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you (No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)34

712 - How Do You Talk To An Angel:The Heights
I hear her voice
In my mind
I know her face by heart
Heaven and earth are moving in my soul
And I dont know where to start
Tell me tell me the words to define
The way I feel about someone so fine

How do you talk to an angel?
How do you hold her close to where you are?
How do you talk to an angel?
It's like tryin' to catch a falling star

At night I dream and she is there
And I can feel her in the air
Tell me tell me the words to define
The way I feel about someone so fine

How do you talk to an angel?
How do you hold her close to where you are?
How do you talk to an angel?
It's like tryin' to catch a falling star

How do you talk to an angel?
How do you hold her close to where you are?
How do you talk to an angel?
It's like tryin' to catch a falling star
 How do you talk to an angel?
How do you hold her close to where you are?
How do you talk to an angel?
It's like tryin' to catch a falling star1

[Verse 1]
I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
It's a feeling that I want to stay

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

[Chorus]
I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)
I lose all control and something takes over me (Control, takes over me)
In a daze and it's so amazing (Amaze)
It's not a phase (It's not), I want you to stay with me (Stay with me)

Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

But your love is strong, it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down when you're around, cries fading
In my condition, I don't want to be alone

With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you, ohh

721 - I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That):Meat Loaf
[Chorus]
And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact
But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
Oh no, no way
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Verse 1]
And some days it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end
And some nights you're breathing fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever
Seen before, or will again

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm crazy
Oh, it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true
You better believe it
 [Chorus]
That I would do anything for love
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way
Tonight
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Post-Chorus]
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

[Verse 2]
And some days I pray for silence
And some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the God
Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll
And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls
[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long, so long
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No no no, I won't do that

[Post-Chorus]
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do
[Chorus]
But I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life
No way
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Spoken: Lorraine Crosby & Meat Loaf]
Will you raise me up?
Will you help me down?
Will you help get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?
I can do that
Oh, I can do that
Will you hold me sacred
Will you hold me tight
Will you colorize my life
I'm so sick of black and white
Can you make it all a little less old?
I can do that
Oh no now, I can do that
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?
Now, I can do that
Ooh now, I can do that
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?
Now, I can do that
Oh now, I can do that
After a while you'll forget everything
As a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
Then you'll see that it's time to move on
I won't do that
I won't do that
I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later, you'll be screwing around
I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Outro]
Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that9

722 - Again:Janet Jackson
[Verse 1]
I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me in my
Mind

[Chorus]
"How can I be strong?" I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

[Verse 2]
A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions, you had many
I know you did
I've come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

[Pre-Chorus]
Making love to you
Ooh, it felt so good and
Ooh, so right
 [Chorus]
"How can I be strong?" I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

[Verse 3]
So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss
I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
I don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

[Bridge]
Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love me then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with
You again

[Outro]
Hold me
Hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do
Love you
Again2

The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
When the world outside's too

It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

[Chorus 2]
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

[Bridge]
The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'm gonna do all that I can

[Chorus 2]
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The power of love
The power of love
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

As I look into your eyes

The power of love3

And I swear like the shadow that's by your side

729 - Stay (I Missed You):Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories
You say I only hear what I want to
You say I talk so all the time, so?
And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong 'cause I missed you
Yeah, yeah, I missed you

And you say I only hear what I want to
I don't listen hard, don't pay attention
To the distance that you're running, to anyone, anywhere
I don't understand if you really care
I'm only hearing negative, no, no, no (Bad)

And so I, I turn the radio on, I turn the radio up (Turn the radio up)
And this woman was singing my song
Lovers in love and the other's run away
Lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay

Some of us hover and we weep for the other
Who was dying since the day they were born
Well, well, this is not that
I think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown

And I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever
That won't take me anyhow or anywhere with you
 You said that I was naive
And I thought that I was strong, oh
I thought, "Hey, I can leave, I can leave"
Oh, but now I know that I was wrong 'cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you
You said you caught me 'cause you want me
And one day you'd let me go
You try to give away a keeper
But keep me 'cause you know you're just so scared to lose
And you say, "Stay"

And you say I only hear what I want to6

731 - On Bended Knee:Boyz II Men
[Verse 1]
Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
And if you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

[Chorus]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

[Verse 2]
So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
And I know I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me
 [Chorus]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be?

I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
Please come back home, girl
I know you put all your trust in me
I'm sorry I let you down
Please forgive me

[Bridge]
I'm Gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe in the spirit of love
It'll heal all things
It won't hurt anymore
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees begging you please
Come home
[Chorus]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be?
Oh God give me a reason

Down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

735 - This Is How We Do It:Montell Jordan
[Intro]
(Background chatter)
This is how we do it!
(This is how we do it!)
Sha la la la la la lo
Shabada lo lo lo, whoa
(This is how we do it!)
Lo lo lo low-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
This is how we do it
It's Friday night, and I feel alright
The party is here on the West Side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver, take the keys to my truck
Hit the 'shaw cause I'm faded
Honies in the street say, "Monty, yo, we made it!"
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gangbangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid

[Pre-Chorus]
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say
 [Chorus]
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (this is how we do it)

[Verse 2]
This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wannabe player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case g
But now I'm a big G
The girls see I got the money
Hundred-dollar bills, y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway

[Pre-Chorus]
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say...

[Chorus]
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
Y?N-Vee, SCC (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)
[Verse 3]
Check it out!
Once upon a time in '94
Montell made no money and life sure was slow
All they said was 6' 8" he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good
There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty, this is what he said
You and Oji are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we're makin' tha dash

[Chorus]
Ohh, I'm buzzin' because... (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)

[Outro]
Oh, it's party time! (This is how we do it)
Straight up comin' from the West Side (This is how we do it)
OG's got the flavor, yeah (This is how we do it)
And Monty does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
C'mon now, Def Jam, you know what it is (This is how we do it)
[Spoken Interlude]
Yo Montell, this Percy, man
The barber, your barber
Man I'm sitting up here listening to ya tape, dude
And this shit is on, man
You gon' make it, fool
Keep on doing what you doing, man
My phone number is area code
Nine oh nine, zero, eighty-
Gimme a call, man
We getting ready to step out to the Fox Hills Mall right now
But, uh
It's Monday morning, about a quarter to eleven, peace18

736 - Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman:Bryan Adams
[Verse 1]
To really love a woman
To understand her - You gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought - See every dream
And give her wings when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

[Verse 2]
To really love a woman - Let her hold you
'Til you know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her - really taste her
'Til you can feel her in your blood
And when you can see your unborn children in her eyes
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that you'll always be together
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?
 [Bridge]
Oh - You got to give her some faith - Hold her tight
A little tenderness - gotta treat her right
She will be there for you, takin' good care of you
You really gotta love your woman

Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

[Outro]
Yeah, just tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?
Oh, just tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?2

738 - You Are Not Alone:Michael Jackson
[Verse 1]
Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be that you're not here with me?
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day, I sit and ask myself "How did love slip away?"
Somethin' whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Post-Chorus]
'Lone, 'lone
Why? 'Lone

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens, I will bear
But first, I need your hand, then forever can begin
 [Pre-Chorus]
Every day, I sit and ask myself "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone, oh-oh-oh

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin', fly
And girl, you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

But you are not alone, I am here with you (Ooh)

I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (Though you're far away, you and me)

Sorry I've never told you
All I wanted to say

Darling, I never showed you (No, no, no, no)

For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right

For all the love I found in you
I would be forever thankful, baby

[Intro]
Yeah
You know what?
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt, uh
Play on, playette
Play on, playette
Yo, Dre, drop the verse

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me **** out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers
[Verse 2: Teddy Riley]
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (Wow)
I think about the girl all the time (Wow-wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?
 [Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey "Black" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up, girl)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Get up)

[Verse 3: Chauncey "Black" Hannibal]
She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild
Very low-key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers, it curves, so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You've got to pay to play
Just for shorty bang-bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride
[Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey "Black" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Oh, yeah)

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Get up)

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo, that girl looks good)

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (You're my kind of girl)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo)
[Verse 4: Queen Pen]
'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a **** thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We bes the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-**** broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been diggin' you so
Please excuse if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how a playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your **** Chauncy
I'll be sending the call, let's say, around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity (No diggity, no doubt, baby)
[Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey "Black" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Girl, you got it going on)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Play on, play on, play on)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hey, ooh)

Brothers wanna, rock my Rolls, rock my clothes
Rock my ice, pull out Glocks, stop my life (Ugh)

Bet against us? (Not a sure bet)
We make hits that'll rearrange your whole set (That's right)

753 - I'll Be Missing You:Puff Daddy & Faith Evans featuring 112
[Interlude: Puff Daddy]
Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's just hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
I would do anything, man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit up, this shit don't mean nothing
I saw your son today, he look just like you
You was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
I miss you, B.I.G. 
Can't wait 'til that day when I see your face again
I can't wait 'til that day when I see your face again

[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Yeah, this right here (Tell me why)
Goes out to everyone that has lost someone
That they truly loved (C'mon, check it out)

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
It seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death
 [Chorus: Faith Evans & Puff Daddy]
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you
Thinkin' of the day
When you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you (I miss you, B.I.G.)

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
It's kinda hard with you not around (Yeah)
Know you in Heaven, smilin' down (Ha)
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts, B.I.G., I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death
[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Every step I take
Every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day
When you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you (Somebody tell me why)

[Interlude: Faith Evans]
One glad morning
When this life is over
I know I'll see your face

[Outro: 112, Puff Daddy & Faith Evans]
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray, every step I take (Every day that passes is a day that I get closer)
Every move I make, every single day (To seeing you again)
Every night I pray, every step I take (We miss you, B.I.G., and we won't stop 'cause we can't stop)
Every move I make, every single day (That's right)
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day (We miss you, B.I.G)
Every step I take50

Without you by my side

- Yeah, you do too. But um, I just wanted to know, do you know somebody named...? You, you know his name
- Oh yeah, definitely. I know his name

It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

[Verse 1: Brandy & Monica]
I think it's time we got this straight
Let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?
You see, I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me
You see, I tried to hesitate
I didn't wanna say what he told me
He said without me, he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame?
But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took (The boy is mine)
 [Chorus: Brandy (& Monica)]
You need to give it up
Had about enough (Enough)
It's not hard to see (Oh)

Must you do the things you do?
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me, not you
And if you didn't know it, girl, it's true
I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside
You can say what you wanna say
What we have, you can't take
From the truth, you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake
When will you get the picture?
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away, it's my time to shine
If you didn't know, the boy is mine, oh (The boy is mine, oh-oh)
[Chorus: Brandy]
You need to give it up
Had about enough (Enough)
It's not hard to see (To see)

[Bridge: Monica & Brandy]
I can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games, I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt

When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart?
He was my love right from the start (The boy is mine)

I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'

I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

[Chorus]
Don't wanna close my eyes

767 - One Week:Barenaked Ladies
[Chorus 1: Steven Page]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, "I'm angry"
Five days since you laughed at me, saying
"Get back together, come back and see me"
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry
[Verse 1: Ed Robertson]
Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know
The vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver
 [Pre-Chorus: Ed Robertson & Steven Page]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

[Chorus 2: Steven Page]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said, "You're crazy"
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Ed Robertson]
Chickity China, the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watching X-Files with no lights on
We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic
Like Sting, I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films, 'kay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing
[Pre-Chorus: Ed Robertson & Steven Page]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt

[Chorus 3: Steven Page & Ed Robertson]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to the sides and said, "I'm sorry"
Five days since I laughed at you and said
"You just did just what I thought you were gonna do"
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame but what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry

[Outro: Steven Page & Ed Robertson]
It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days 'til we say "Wasabi"

770 - I'm Your Angel:R. Kelly & Céline Dion
[Verse 1: Céline Dion]
No mountains too high, for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith, oh yeah
No rivers too wide, for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray

[Pre-Chorus: R. Kelly]
And then you will see, the morning will come
And every day will be bright as the sun
All of your fears, cast them on me
I just want you to see

[Chorus: Céline Dion & R. Kelly]
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
I saw the teardrops, and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way, let me show you a better day
 [Pre-Chorus: Céline Dion]
And then you will see, the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears, just cast them on me
How can I make you see?

[Chorus: Céline Dion & R. Kelly]
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel

[Verse 3: Céline Dion & R. Kelly]
And when it's time to face the storm
I'll be right by your side
Grace will keep us safe and warm
And I know we will survive
And when it seems as if your end is drawing near
(It is drawing near)
Don't you dare give up the fight (Oh no)
Just put your trust beyond the skies
[Chorus: Céline Dion & R. Kelly]
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
Oh...oh...oh-oh...I'm your angel4

771 - Have You Ever:Brandy
[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever
(Have you ever)

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been in love
Been in love so bad
You'd do anything, to make them understand
Have you ever had someone, steal your heart away
You'd give anything, to make them feel the same
Have you ever searched for words to get you in their heart
But you don't know what to say
And you don't know where to start?

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever
(Have you ever), (Oh)
 [Verse 2]
Have you ever found the one
You've dreamed of all of your life
You'd just about anything, to look into their eyes
Have you finally found the one, you've given your heart to
Only to find that one, won't give their heart to you
Have you ever closed your eyes and dreamed that they were there
And all you can do is wait, for the day when they will care

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
(Makes you wanna break down and cry)
Have you, have you ever needed something (So, so bad)
(So bad you can't sleep at night)
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't, come out right, (Oh)
Have you ever, have you ever, ever ever, (Oh)

[Bridge]
What do I gotta do to get you in my arms, baby
What do I gotta say to get to your heart
To make you understand, how I need you next to me
Gotta get you in my world
'Cause, baby, I can't sleep
[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you, have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night
(Breaks you down  inside)
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right (Oh)

Have you ever
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night (Just can't sleep at night)
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right? (Don't come out right)
Have you ever, have you ever, ever, ever
Have you ever?11

At first, we started out real cool
Takin' me places I ain't never been

Ain't doin' those things you did no more
You're slowly makin' me pay for things
Your money should be handling

To even come and step to me and
Ask to hold some money from me

Don't know where none of these calls come from
When your momma's number's here more than once

780 - Unpretty:TLC
[Verse 1: T-Boz]
I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror, who's inside there?
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
My outsides look cool, my insides look blue
Every time I think I'm through, it's because of you
I tried different ways, but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

[Chorus: T-Boz & Chilli]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that made me feel
So damn unpretty
Yeah, I'll make you feel unpretty too
 [Verse 2: T-Boz & Chilli]
Never insecure until I met you, now I'm bein' stupid
I used to be so cute to me, just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things to keep you happy?
Maybe get rid of you and then I'll get back to me (Heyeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
My outsides look cool, my insides look blue
Every time I think I'm through, it's because of you
I tried different ways, but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
Can't believe I'm trippin'

[Chorus: T-Boz & Chilli]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that made me feel
So damn unpretty

[Chorus: T-Boz & Chilli]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that made me feel
So damn unpretty
[Post-Chorus: T-Boz & Chilli]
And make you feel unpretty too
And make you feel unpretty
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus: T-Boz & Chilli]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that made me feel
So damn unpretty
You can buy your hair if it won't grow (Hahahaha)
You can buy all the make-up
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Be in the position that made me feel so
You can buy your hair if it won't grow10

Boy, your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey & JAY-Z]
Boy, if I do
The things you want me to
Uh-huh
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby
Uh-huh
Or leave me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?

It's a shame to be
So euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me the things
That you know
Persuade me to relinquish my love
To you
But I cannot resist at all
[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Boy, if I do
The things you wanna do
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby (Love me, oh)
Or leaving me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
(Heartbreaker, you got the best of me)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me (You got the best)
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (I keep on, keep on)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
(Why, why did you have to run your game?)
I should have known right from the start
(The start that you'd go and break my heart)
You'd go and break my heart

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I'm all over ready
Okay, cool, alright
She wanna shop with Jay
Play box with Jay
She wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spying again
She wanna roll with Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my date
She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms
She calls me heartbreaker
When we apart, it makes her want a piece of paper
Scribble down "I hate ya", but she knows she loves Jay because
She loves everything Jay say, Jay does, and all

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
(Oh boy, you got the best of me)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (I keep on coming back)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me
(Why did you have to run your game?)
I should have known right from the start
(Right from the start that you'd)
You'd go and break my heart (Go and break my heart)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me?
(I should have known) I should have known right from the start
(That you would go and break my heart)
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
(Boy, if I do) Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
(The things you want me to)
(The way I used to do)
Oh, why did you have to (Would you love me, baby?)
Run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
(Or leave me feeling used) Right from the start
(Would you go and break?) (My heart)
You'd go and break my heart

You might say this is Ludacris
But Taio Cruz, tell her how you feel!

You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong

Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back

This is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets

Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?" I say

[Chorus]
When I see your face (Face, face)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)
And when you smile (Smile, smile)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)
Yeah
 [Verse 2]
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother askin' if you look okay
You know I'll say

[Chorus]
When I see your face (Face, face)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)
And when you smile (Smile, smile)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)

[Bridge]
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)
[Chorus]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

Please forgive me if I'm coming on too strong

809 - Someone Like You:Adele
[Verse 1]
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Verse 2]
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
 [Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Bridge]
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

[Breakdown]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead221

812 - Set Fire to the Rain:Adele
[Produced by Fraser T. Smith]

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
 [Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time
[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you

[Chorus]
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Outro]
Oh
Oh, no
Let it burn
Oh
Let it burn
Let it burn106

[Verse 1]
You know the bed feels warmer
Sleepin' here alone (Sleepin' here alone)
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want (Do the things I want)

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'll come running back
Baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong

[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
 [Verse 2]
You heard that I was starting over with someone new
They told you I was moving on and over you

You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You tried to break me, but you see

[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

Thanks to you, I'm not the broken-hearted
Thanks to you I'm finally thinkin' 'bout me
You know in the end, the day you left was just my beginning
In the end

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

[Verse 1]
Days like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade

[Pre-Chorus]
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Verse 2]
I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
 [Pre-Chorus]
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

So you can keep the diamond ring
It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact, you can keep everything
Yeah, yeah, except for me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no (Away from me)

Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul (My soul)
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

815 - We Are Young:Fun featuring Janelle Monáe
[Verse 1: Nate Ruess]
Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom
Getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget it
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
 [Verse 2: Nate Ruess]
Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a toast
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun

[Bridge: Janelle Monáe & Nate Ruess]
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight
The moon is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight?
The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come and carry me home?
[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun

[Outro: Nate Ruess]
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home tonight108

816 - Somebody That I Used to Know:Gotye featuring Kimbra
[Verse 1: Gotye]
Now and then, I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Gotye]
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that, though
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
 [Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Kimbra]
Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ah)
And I don't even need your love (Ooh)
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough (Ah)
No, you didn't have to stoop so low (Ooh)
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (Ah)
I guess that I don't need that, though (Ooh)
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
[Outro: Gotye, Gotye & Kimbra]
Somebody (I used to know)
Somebody (Now, you're just somebody that I used to know)
Somebody (I used to know)
Somebody (Now, you're just somebody that I used to know)
(I used to know)
(That I used to know)
(I used to know)

Told me she not a pro, it's okay, it's under control

Baby, we start slow, then you come up and park close

Talented with your lips like you blew out a candle

818 - We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together:Taylor Swift
[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
 [Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever"

[Chorus]

But I'll only stay with you one more night

Try to tell you "no," but my body keeps on telling you "yes"

Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome (Now)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Walk into the club like, "What up? I got a big cock"
Nah, I'm just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, "Damn, that's a cold-ass honkey"
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents (Bag it)
Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it, man, I am stunting and flossin'
And saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain, bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie-brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, "Ah, he got the Velcros"
 [Chorus: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm diggin', I'm diggin', I'm searchin' right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button-
Up shirt 'cause right now, I'm up in here stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
I'm not, I'm not stuck on searchin' in that section (Men's)
Your grammy, your auntie, your mama, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies second hand and rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, "Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight"
I'm like, "Yo, that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt"
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella dope
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryna get girls from a brand? Man, you hella won't
Man, you hella won't
Goodwill
Poppin' tags, yeah
[Chorus: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Bridge: Wanz]
I'll wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big-ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road
I'll wear your granddad's clothes (Damn right)
I look incredible (Now come on, man)
I'm in this big-ass coat (Big-ass coat)
From that thrift shop down the road (Let's go, come on)

[Chorus: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

824 - When I Was Your Man:Bruno Mars
[Verse 1]
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man

[Verse 2]
Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
 [Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man

[Bridge]
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that
I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you love to dance
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man179

828 - Roar:Katy Perry
[Verse 1]
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Got up)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire

Louder, louder than a lion

We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

All you ever did was wreck me

830 - Royals:Lorde
[Verse 1]
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

[Pre-Chorus]
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
 [Verse 2]
My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tiger's on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
[Bridge]
(Oh, oh-oh)
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen
(Oh, oh-oh)
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)

Drawing me in and you kicking me out

You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really 'cause

[Chorus]
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Verse 2]
She walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle, yeah, yeah
'Cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
 [Pre-Chorus]
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really 'cause

[Chorus]
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Bridge]
Hmm, she gives me love and affection
Baby, did I mention?
You're the only girl for me
No, I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too
She thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do
Is just for me to pop the question

[Chorus]
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her46

846 - Hello:Adele
[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
 [Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
[Chorus]
So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Anymore
[Chorus]
Hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

847 - Sorry:Justin Bieber
[Written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Justin Bieber]

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Drop]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
 [Verse 2]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

[Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm not just tryna get you back on me (Oh, no, no)
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body (Your body)
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Drop]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down (I know I let you down)
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?101

848 - Love Yourself:Justin Bieber
[Produced by Benny Blanco]

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
 [Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself150

[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
 [Verse 2]
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]

Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for

You know dark days, you know hard times
Doin' overtime for the last month
Saturday, call the girls, get 'em gassed up
Gotta hit the club, gotta make that ass jump
Gotta hit the club like you hit them mothafuckin' angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo

[Verse 1]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)

Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just runnin' from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

Said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)

Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah
[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes

879 - Someone You Loved:Lewis Capaldi
[Verse 1]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
 [Bridge]
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

[Chorus]
For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved168

[Verse 2]
There's just no rhyme or reason
Only this sense of completion
And in your eyes, I see the missing pieces (I'm searching for)
I think I found my way home
 [Pre-Chorus]
I know that it might sound more than a little
Crazy, but I believe...

[Chorus]
I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
A thousand angels dance around you
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
I am complete now that I've found you

[Chorus]
I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into my life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life
[Outro]
I knew I loved you before I met you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
I knew I loved you
I knew I loved you before I met you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
I knew I loved you
I knew I loved you before I met you (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I knew I loved you before I met you (Yeah, yeah, oh)
I knew I loved you7

886 - Thank God I Found You:Mariah Carey featuring Joe and 98 Degrees
[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I would give up everything
Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering
I finally found unvarnished truth
I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heartache would not subside
I felt like dying
Until you saved my life

[Chorus: All]
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you

[Verse 2: Joe & 98°]
I will give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you
'Cause without you beside me I can't survive
Don't wanna try
If you keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be alright
'Cause I need you in my life
 [Chorus: All]
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby, I'm so thankful I found you

[Bridge: All]
See, I was so desolate before you came to me
Looking back
I guess it shows that we were destined
To shine over the rain, to appreciate
The gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel
This way

[Chorus: 98° with ad-libs from Mariah Carey & Joe]
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
See baby, I'm so thankful I found you
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby, I'm so thankful I found
You
You
[Outro: Mariah Carey]
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude

890 - Be With You:Enrique Iglesias
[Verse 1]
Monday night and I feel so low
I count the hours, but they go so slow
I know the sound of your voice can save my soul
City lights, streets of gold
Look out my window to the world below
Moves so fast, but it feels so cold
And I'm all alone (All alone)

Don't let me die
I'm losing my mind

Come to me now
I got to be with you somehow

891 - Everything You Want:Vertical Horizon
[Verse 1]
Somewhere there's speaking
It's already coming in
Oh, and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why
But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

[Chorus 1]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Verse 2]
You're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say
 [Chorus 1]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Bridge]
But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

[Verse 3]
Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away the
Anger of angels who won't return
[Chorus 1]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Chorus 2]
I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you
And I don't know why

[Outro]
And I don't know why
Why
I don't know9

892 - Bent:Matchbox Twenty
[Verse 1]
And if I fall along the way
Pick me up and dust me off
And if I get too tired to make it
Be my breath so I can walk
And if I need some other love, then
Give me more than I can stand
And when my smile gets old and faded
Wait around, I'll smile again

[Pre-Chorus]
Shouldn't be so complicated
Just hold me and then
Oh, just hold me again

[Chorus]
Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together
Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent

[Verse 2]
And if I couldn't sleep, could you sleep?
Could you paint me better off?
And could you sympathize with my needs?
I know you think I need a lot
 [Pre-Chorus]
I started out clean but I'm jaded
Just phoning it in
Oh, just breaking the skin

[Chorus]
Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together
Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent

[Bridge]
Start bending me
It's never enough till I feel all your pieces
Start bending me
Keep bending me until I'm completely broken in

[Pre-Chorus]
Shouldn't be so complicated
Just touch me and then
Oh, just touch me again

[Chorus]
Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together
Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me landin' without understanding
Hell, I'd go there again
Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together
Yeah, you're breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent6

894 - Incomplete:Sisqó
[Intro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Oh yeah yeah, uh
Listen

[Verse 1]
Bright lights, fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still, I'm lonely now
Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines
From their covers to my covers, wanna lay with me
Fame and fortune still can't find
Just a grown man runnin' out of time

[Chorus]
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you, girl, my life is incomplete
Said, without you girl, ahh
Listen
 [Verse 2]
Your perfume, your sexy lingerie
Girl, I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was
It's been a year, winter, summer, spring and fall
But bein' without you just ain't livin' ain't nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

[Chorus]
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you, girl, my life is incomplete
Oh yeah, that without you, girl, ahh

[Bridge]
I just can't help lovin' you
But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything, ha
And everything
To hear you say
That you'll stay
[Chorus]
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
(All of the women, all of the money)
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything (Just give me my baby)
But I can't pretend that I don't see (Yeah, yeah)
That without you, girl, my life is incomplete
(Without you, alright, alright, alright)
Even though it seems I have everything  (Even though it seems)
I don't wanna be a lonely fool (That I got everything)
All of the women, all the expensive cars
(I don't have you, I don't have you, you make me wanna cry, baby)
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything (Oh)
But I can't pretend that I don't see (Baby, hey, yeah)
That without you girl my life is incomplete

We stand in awe, we've created life

[Chorus]
With arms wide open under the sunlight
Welcome to this place, I'll show you everything
With arms wide open, now everything has changed
I'll show you love, I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open
I'll show you everything, ah, yeah
With arms wide open
Wide open
 [Guitar Solo: Mark Tremonti]

[Verse 3]
If I had just one wish, only one demand
I hope he's not like me, I hope he understands
That he can take this life and hold it by the hand
And he can greet the world with arms wide open

[Chorus]
With arms wide open under the sunlight
Welcome to this place, I'll show you everything
With arms wide open, now everything has changed
I'll show you love, I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open
I'll show you everything, ah, yeah
With arms wide open

899 - Independent Women:Destiny's Child
* a parody of "Independent Women" by Destiny's Child

Oh, oh yo
Question tell me what you know about me
At the dice game nothing less than a G
Got my own ride and I got my own bread
Even bought the chicken scrap wig on your head
Question, ask me how i feel about chicks
Best be independent cause you ain't gettin' shit
The only time I trick is December 25th
I'm coming with a rolls, some kicks, and some dick

There's one thing worse then a chick saying "I just want chedda"
Uh-oh, that's a motherfuckin' child's support letter
First she want her bills paid now she independent
Sounds more like these chicks is inconsistent
These days everybody wanna male bash
I tell 'em real fast to kiss my male ass
Listen, this is how it works
I want to fuck you on my money
Baby it just who gets who first
Now you all hurt telling the word nonsense
It ain't my fault you fell in love in the process
Got pregnant young now hun is stuck
But if I'm taking care of my son then shut the fuck up
Bitch I got no time to hear your heart broke
I owe like two months rent and a fucking car note
Take it as a quote not an answer back
And if so suck my dick, somebody answer that
 Cause the clothes on my kid
(I bought it)
Everything in my crib
(I bought it)
The lawyer from my bid
(I bought it)
Even though I lost the case
(But I fought it)
The telly i bring my hoes
(I bought it)
Grams on top of grams
(I bought it)
The one train downtown
(I bought it)
Get money fuck a bitch

1 - Yo, all my niggas who independent
(Throw your hands up with me)
All my niggas who gettin' paper
(Throw your hands up with me)
All my niggas who keeps it gravy
(Throw your hands up with me)
Understanding that life ain't easy
(Throw your hands up with me)

Yo man I'm independent cause I know
I can spend my last on a fresh jar of 'dro
And still up to date with the Benz for the crib
And helpin' mom dukes keepin' food in the fridge
(Answer) Don't ever judge a nigga by his dough
He could be independent whether rich or poor
As long as you know where all your money go
Niggas know when not to give a fuck about a ho
Check it out, my life hard man
All I gotta do is flip
Chicks want a yard all they gotta do is strip, its that easy
A brother want a check, he get a job
Some chicks want a check, they get pregnant
That ain't right, but fuck it, it's straight blood
Wanna wreck a nigga's life for two hundred dollars a month
Won't let you see your seed actin' like it's funny
She gettin' her hair done with that diaper money
Independent, I know cats that's fightin' to live
A week won't eat to keep lights in the crib
Gas in the tank, shoes on the act
California plates with dubes on the back
I'm just here to stack on digits
So happen I get paid to come back on bitches
Rep my niggas, get brain and keep on skeetin'
We keep on with these hoes, we gon' keep on eatin'

Cause the rims on my jeep
(I bought it)
The Timbs on my feet
(I bought it)
The couch that I sleep
(I bought it)
And I don't give a fuck
(Cause I bought it)
My web ain't no six
(I bought it)
Every bitch you saw me with
(I scored it)
The last time I tricked
(I can't call it)
Cause I look's out for me
Know what I mean?
Repeat 1

West coast didn't know you get's down like that
Dirty south didn't know you get's down like that
Up north didn't know you get's down like that
To my niggas didn't know you get's down like that
Sporty didn't know you get's down like that

Sporty Thievz is here
Just to let my niggas know
That we come to get the dough
Set this paper, fuck these hoes

[Intro: Rikrok & Shaggy]
Yo, man
Yo
Open up, man
Yo, what you want, man?
My girl just caught me
You made her catch you?
I don't know how I let this happen
With who?
The girl next door, ya know?
Man
I don't know what to do
Say it wasn't you
Alright

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
How ya fi give the woman access to your villa?
Trespasser and a witness, all the hacklin' a yuh pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killa
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player, you haffi know how fi play
If she say, "A night," convince her, say, "A day"
Never admit to a word weh she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, "Baby, no way!"
 [Pre-Chorus: Rikrok & Shaggy]
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?

[Verse 2: Shaggy]
Mek she know say that she really no have right fi vex
A never you she see yah make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else weh favor you inna di complex
Seein' is believin', so you better change your specs
You know she a go bring a whole heap a things up from the past
All the likkle evidence, you betta know fi mask
Quick 'pon yuh answer, know how fi talk
But if she pack a gun, you know you betta run fast
[Pre-Chorus: Rikrok & Shaggy]
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wa-wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me
[Bridge: Rikrok]
Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin', it makes no sense at all
Need to tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player, but you're completely lost
That's why I sing
[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me79

902 - Butterfly:Crazy Town
[Chorus]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby

[Verse 1]
Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passin', I'm askin', "Could this be real?"
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel, too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so yo, I'm puttin' it down

[Chorus]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
 [Verse 2]
I don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious, then I guess it's true
But to tell the truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happenin' now?
I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so

[Chorus]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

[Verse 3]
Hey sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, it's me and you like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' 'bout butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss
[Breakdown]
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So come and dance with me
Uh huh, uh huh

[Chorus]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

[Outro]

906 - U Remind Me:Usher
[Intro]
Yo, I ain't seen you in a minute
But I got something to tell you
Listen

[Verse 1]
See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kind of hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
See this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

[Chorus]
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

[Verse 2]
Thought that she was the one for me
Til I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexing everyone, but me
This is why we could never be
 [Chorus]
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

[Bridge]
I know it's so unfair to you (it's so unfair)
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew
Wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me (you remind me)

[Chorus]
Whoa whoa oh oh oh oh
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you, (gotta let you go)
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (all the shit she put me through)
This is why I just can't get with you, no no
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

[Intro: Ja Rule & Jennifer Lopez]
(Murder Inc)
What's my motherfuckin' name?!
R-U-L-E
Blowin' back on this Mary Jane, I'm analyzin' the game
And the game done chose me
To bring pain to pussy niggas & pussy hoes
They're one in the same
Ever since you told me
There's only room for two, I've been makin' less room for you
Now only God can hold me
Hug me, love me, judge me
The only man that hovers above me, holla

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
I met so many men and it's like they're all the same
My appetite for loving is now my hunger pain
And when I'm feeling sexy, who's gonna comfort me?
My only problem is their insecurity

[Pre-Chorus: Ja Rule, Jennifer Lopez, Together]
Tired of being alone? Yeah, yeah
Sick of arguing on the phone? Yeah, yeah
Are you telling all your friends (Yeah, yeah)
That your nigga don't understand my love?
 [Chorus: Jennifer Lopez, Ja Rule, Together]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

[Verse 2: Ja Rule with Jennifer Lopez]
Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout this relationship
And I wanna know is this as good as it gets?
'Cause we've been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time, even if it was part-time
Now they been lookin' at me, smilin' at me
Laughin' like we wasn't happy
But not knowin' that we're growin' and we gettin' married
Hard lovin' and straight thuggin'
Bitch, I ain't doin' this shit for nothing
I'm here to get it poppin', hop in', let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowin' in the wind, sun glistenin' off my skin, hey
I'm nasty, heh, you know me
But you still don't fuck with your baby

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez, Ja Rule, Together]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you
[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Now people lovin' me and hating me, treating me ungratefully
But not knowing that they ain't making or breaking me
My life I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again
Now people screaming what the deal with you and so and so
I tell them niggas mind their biz, but they don't hear me though
'Cause I live my life to the limit and I love it
Now I could breathe again, baby, now I could breathe again

[Pre-Chorus: Ja Rule, Jennifer Lopez, Together]
Tired of being alone? Yeah, yeah
Sick of arguing on the phone? Yeah, yeah
Are you telling all your friends (Yeah, yeah)

The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair

911 - U Got It Bad:Usher
[Intro]
Ooh-oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ooh

[Verse 1]
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been there, done it, humped around, ha
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

[Chorus]
(You) You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone (Oh yeah), hang up and you call right back
(Oh you) You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad
 [Verse 2]
When you say that you love 'em and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (You can have it all and)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just 'cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know, I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her, "I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world"
Ladies, say, "I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can"

[Pre-Chorus]
See, I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad (Hey, hey, no, no)
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, ha, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track (Yeah)
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house (Oh, you're stuck)
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about (Look at yourself)
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else (Somebody)
You got it bad
[Electric Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else31

912 - How You Remind Me:Nickelback
[Verse 1]
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of livin' like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me

[Pre-Chorus]
This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

[Post-Chorus]
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no

[Verse 2]
It's not like you didn't know that
I said, "I love you," and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause livin' with me must have damn near killed you
 [Pre-Chorus]
And this is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

[Post-Chorus]
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no

[Bridge]
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealin'
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me
[Pre-Chorus]
This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

[Outro]
Yet, yet, are we havin' fun yet?
Yet, yet, are we havin' fun yet?
Yeah, yeah (These five words in my head scream)
Are we havin' fun yet?
Yeah, yeah (These five words in my head)
No, no43

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyein' me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin' your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care
 [Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time
And I gave you my all
Now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like, the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money over bitches, Murder, I.N.C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care
[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time
And I gave you my all
Now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time (yeah)
And I gave you my all (yo)
Now baby be mine

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Oh I, feelin' like you livin' a, double life
'Cause you don't be coming home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checking for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care
[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time
And I gave you my all
Now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time
And I gave you my all

[Verse 1]
What if I told you it was all meant to be?
Would you believe me? Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling that we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now

A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this

Everything changes, but beauty remains
Something so tender, I can't explain
Well, I may be dreamin', but 'til I awake
Can we make this dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love we share

We do it for fun
We just do it for fun
Derrty ENT
We do it for fun
Bad Boy (Nelly, Diddy, Murphy Lee)
(This is history baby)
We do it for fun
Bend them trucks
We do it for fun
Stack them bucks
We do it for fun (Come on now)
And the band played on
We do it for fun
Singing my song
We do it for fun
Bad Boys 2, the soundtrack
Let's go

[Verse 1: Nelly]
Come here girl, what your name is?
Where you from? Turn around; who you came with?
Is that your ass or your mama half reindeer?
I can't explain it but damn sure glad you came here
I'm still a sucker for cornrows, you know I never changed that
Your body is banging mama, but where your brains at?
I'm still the same cat when I was younger running with bad boys
But now I'm on the hook and so I'm running with Bad Boy
Here come another man, unlike no other man
Candy coated (what!) switching every other lane
Lord help me, why don't cha please help me
Eighth girl this week and it's only Tuesday
I like the cocky bowlegged ones
Black, white and Dominicans
Hispanics and Asians, please shake it for Nelly San
Manolos, Ma-no-no's, I can't tell
Everybody ain't that rich, just when you do it, do it well
 [Chorus: Nelly &  (Diddy)]
Let me see you take it low
(Girl, go and take it low)
We can even do it slow
(We can even do it slow)
Take it where you want to go
(Take it where you want to go)
Just take that ass to the floor
(Pop something, move something, shake ya tailfeather)
(Girl, go and take it low)
We can even do it slow
(We can even do it slow)
Take it where you want to go
(Take it where you want to go)
Just take that ass to the floor
(Pop something, move something, shake ya tailfeather)

[Verse 2: Diddy & (Nelly)]
Now real girls get down on the floor (On the floor)
Now get that money, honey, act like you know (Like you know)
Mama, I like how you dance, the way you fit in them pants (Uh)
And to the floor (Uh) take it low (Uh) girl, do it again (Uh)
You know I love that (I love that)
Now where them girls at? (Where the girls at?)
It's Diddy, Murphy Lee, and Nelly, how you love that? (Shit, uh oh)
Come on, we got another one player
From New York to the Dirty, how they loving it player?
Baby, you impressive, let's get
To know each other
You the best of the best and
You got to love it in the dresses, the sexiest
I had to tell her she's a young Janet Jackson live in living color
Look here mama you're dead wrong for having them pants on
Capri's cut low so when you shake it I see your thong
My pocket's full of dough, shake your feathers 'til the morning
It's Bad Boy and Nelly, man, somebody better warn them
[Chorus: Nelly & (Diddy)]
Let me see you take it low
(Girl, go and take it low)
We can even do it slow
(We can even do it slow)
Take it where you want to go

Just take that ass to the floor
(Pop something, move something, shake ya tailfeather)
(Girl, go and take it low)
We can even do it slow
(We can even do it slow)
Take it where you want to go
(Take it where you want to go)
Just take that ass to the floor
(Pop something, move something, shake ya tailfeather)

[Bridge: Nelly]
Oh no, I heard them bad boys coming
Can't stop now
Got to continue my running (Yeah)
'Cause we gon' party 'til the lights come on
And if my song stop, fuck it 'cause my mic's still on, man

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee & (Nelly)]
Yo, I'm the big booty type
I like 'em thick with their mind right (Aw)
Banging personality, conversate when the time right (Naw)
I'm not hard, I've got women to handle that
They be like, "He the man," when I'm really a Thundercat
Come on, you know the 'Tics connect like Voltron
Collect so much grass, popo thinking we mow lawns
My Cole Haans don't match that
But it matches her headwrap and the seats that I got in the 'Lac
I'm just a Juvenile, 'cause I Be about G's
Keep the women Weezy, Mannie say they have my Babys
I'm Young like Turk, I like that Cash and that Money
(I'mma eat my money) Man, I'm that damn hungry
You see I'm starvin' like Marvin, girl
I've got sixteen bars of fire is what I'm starting
Plus my rats come in packs like Sammy and Dean Martin
And I got so many keys, you think I'm valet parking (Get it?)
[Chorus: Nelly & (Diddy)]
Let me see you take it low
(Girl, go and take it low)
We can even do it slow
(We can even do it slow)

Rims still movin' so I bump a lil' Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b, dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got the heat on the 23's
And I do it (Well well well well)

Let me get ya sheets wet listenin' to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit' Maze

I'm lovin' the way you be holdin' me when I be listenin' to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass

Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last

Ohh! (Watch out)
She's sayin', "Come get me" (Come get me)

And I gotta keep it real now
'Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty
But that just ain't me (Hey!)

Just where's it gonna lead?
But what I do know is the way she dance

(Hey! Hey! Luda!)

[Verse 3: Ludacris, Lil Jon & Both]
Watch out, my outfit's ridiculous
In the club, lookin' so conspicuous
And "roar!", these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow (Yeah!)
And forget about game, I'ma spit the truth (What?)
I won't stop 'til I get 'em in their birthday suit (Yeah!)
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
Then bend over to the front, and touch your toes
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cuttin', then I put 'em on foot patrol (Let's go!)
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please (Yeah!)
Ludacris fill cups like double D's (Yeah!)
Me and Ursh' once more, and we leave some dead
We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed, that say
[Chorus: Usher & Lil Jon]
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shawty got down low, she said, "come and get me"
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me, screamin'
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!

932 - Burn:Usher
[Intro]
Girl, I understand why
See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is somethin' I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm tryna say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming, but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you (No, no)
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn (Let it burn), let it burn (Let it burn), gotta let it burn
 [Verse 2]
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feelin' ain't the same
Find myself callin' her your name
Ladies, tell me, do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now to get my shorty back?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn)
Let it burn (Gotta let it burn, oh), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over (Know it's over), we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
[Bridge]
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, ooh
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Can you feel me burning?)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn), let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn)
Let it burn, gotta let it burn34

934 - Confessions Part II:Usher
[Intro]
Watch this

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

[Verse 1]
Now, this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told y'all I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true?
Third thing was me wishing that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say (Oh, oh)
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Yeah, yeah)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do (No)
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions (This is part two)
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (Tell it all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (I don't know, I don't know)
But to give you part two of my confessions
 [Verse 2]
Sitting here, stuck on stupid, tryin' to figure out
When, what, and how I'ma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with, over with
I'm riding in my whip, racin' to her place
Talking to myself, preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't wanna come near me
I said, "One second, baby, please hear me"

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Chick on the side, oh I)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed (So gone, so gone) and I don't know what to do
(What to do) I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (Cried, when I got it)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (Didn't know what to do)
But to give you part two of my confessions (But I need to tell you, baby)

[Interlude]
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm havin' a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please
[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions23

Cut throater, have you like a brand new virgin
It's like when you get used of it then you start serving
Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jerking
Slow down for me, a-you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping, I'm tryna grip that ass
Keep being hard-headed and I'ma make you get off me
Got human enough disguise but my face is a doggy
If you loving my bark let me bury my bone
I got four or five bad married bitches at home
One of my bitches feel in love with that outside dick
That outside dick keep them hoes sick like

It's like I got the world in my palms
Your girl up under my arms, she fucked up from the charm
She love the way the dick stay hard from 12 'til early in the morn'
Fine bitches if you listening, you heard me, I'm strong
If you going through your cycle, I ain't with it, I'm gone
You must have heard about them hoes that I beat up in my home
They wasn't telling the truth baby, you know they was wrong
Now, make it official, wind up some of that dome
I don't mind buying blue, your riding to
Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you
Lil mama my shit together, I ain't jiving you
I don't think that nigga could do you better then I could do, ya know
And Juvenile from cross the street by the derby
Same nigga that used to be running with Rusty and Kirby
Can a playa from the 'Nolia get a chance with it?
But I can't bounce with you without using my hands with it
[Chorus: Soulja Slim]
Ughh! I like it like that
She working that back, I don't know how to act

Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me

[Verse 3: Soulja Slim]
Slow motion, she open, I'm hoping she don't leave my dick broken
With brush burns and swollen
I'm toting, she wanted me to make her out a believer
I gurantee ya I'ma see ya when I see ya
And just don't holla out my name like we was all that
Your pussy throw back and you know that
So stop stunting, slow motion for a real nigga
I'm going off that incredible potion and I'ma deal with ya

[Verse 4: Juvenile]
I like how that Victoria Secret sit in that ass
Let me pour some more hip and Hennsey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handful?
I know what's happening, all I want is a sample
Who you with? I'm in the rental today
It's going down and happening and I remember the way
Less money we spend on bullshit, the more for the weed
What's it gonna take for you to come slow motion with me?

Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me

936 - Lean Back:Terror Squad
[Intro: Fat Joe]
Owwwwww! Yeah! My niggas, ahah
Throw your hands in the air right now, man!
Feel this shit right here, Scott Storch, nigga
Yeah Khaled, I see you nigga, ShowBiz, Born Lord
Uh, yeah, uh, yo

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I don't give a fuck about your faults or mishappens
Nigga, we from the Bronx, New York; shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the Squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga, this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a youngin, was too much to cope with
Why you think, muh'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit?
Should've been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo, kid

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
 [Verse 2: Remy Martin]
R to the Ezzy, M to the Yzzy
My arms stay breezy, the Don stay flizzy
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-4-fizzive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride 'til I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen, we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a V.I.P section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thang, nigga, we still the same niggas
Flows just changed, now we 'bout to change the game, nigga

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla: to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come then they'd proudly squeal
Cause half these rappers they blow like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm gon' hurt you
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K Crip walkin' like, "That's what's up!"
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about the Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the Rucker
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)19

My goodies, my goodies, my goodies
Not my goodies

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo & Ciara]
I got a sick reputation for handlin' broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more (A few seconds or more)
And it's a wrap, tell valet to bring my 'Lac
And I ain't comin' back
So you can put a car right there (Put a car right there)
I'm the truth, and I ain't got nothin' to prove
And you can ask anybody 'cause they seen me do it (They seen me do it)
Barricades? I run right through 'em, used to 'em
Throw all the dirt you want, I'm used to it (It's no use)
You still won't have a pin-up in a fabulous room
On her back, pickin' out baskets of fruit (I love you, boo)
Yeah, Freak and Petey love you too (Yeah), ha-ha
You know how I do it (That goodie, goodie)

[Verse 2: Ciara]
You may look at me and think that I'm just a young girl
But I'm not just a young girl

Sexy, independent, gotta spend it type that's gettin' his dough
I'm not bein' too dramatic, that's the way I gotta have it
 [Chorus: Ciara]
I bet you want the goodies (Ugh)
Bet you thought about it (Yeah)
Got you all hot and bothered (Ow)
Mad 'cause I talk around it
If you're lookin' for the goodies
Keep on lookin', 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 3: Ciara]
Just because you drive a Benz
I'm not goin' home with you
You won't get no nookie or the cookies, I'm no rookie
If you ain't sexy, independent
I ain't with it, so you already know
I'm not bein' too dramatic, that's the way I gotta have it
You may talk slick, tryna hit, but I'm not dumb
I'm not bein' too dramatic, it's just how I gotta have it

[Chorus: Ciara]
I bet you want the goodies (Ugh)
Bet you thought about it (Yeah)

So damn hot, but so young (So young)
You ain't got milk on ya tongue, slow down, lil' one
We ain't got long
Hey shorty, you little thing (Wait a minute)
You think you bad but you ain't bad
I'll show you what bad is
Bad is when you're capable of beatin' the bag
I've been workin' at it ever since I came to this planet
I ain't quite there yet, but I'm gettin' better at it
Matter of fact, let me tell it to you one mo' 'gain
All I got to do is tell a girl who I am (Petey)
Ain't ne'er chick in here that I can't have
Bada boom, bada bam, ba-bam (I'm Bad)

[Verse 5: Ciara]
You're insinuating that I'm hot
But these goodies, boy, are not
Just for any of the many men that's tryna get on top
No, you can't call me later
And I don't want your number
I'm not changin' stories
Just respect the play I'm callin'

[Chorus: Ciara]
I bet you want the goodies (Ugh)
Bet you thought about it (Yeah)
Got you all hot and bothered (Ow)
Mad 'cause I talk around it
If you're lookin' for the goodies
Keep on lookin', 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah

Even before all the fame and people screamin' your name
Girl, I was there when you were my baby

It started when we were younger, you were mine (My boo)
Now another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes (My boo)

I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
I was in love with you when we were younger, you were mine (My boo)
And I see it from time to time, I still feel like (My boo, that's my baby)
And I can see it no matter how I try to hide (I can't hide it, my boo)
And even though there's another man who's in my life
You will always be my boo
 [Verse 2: Alicia Keys with Usher]
Yes, I remember, boy
'Cause after we kissed, I could only think about your lips
Yes, I remember, boy
The moment I knew you were the one I could spend my life with
Even before all the fame and people screaming your name

Temperature risin', okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam-packed, hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you
Wanna show me you could work it, baby? No problem
Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit

Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door, she get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race, who could get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip 'til every bubble in every bottle is gone
[Chorus: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop

Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa

942 - We Belong Together:Mariah Carey
[Intro]
Sweet love, yeah

[Verse 1]
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I shoulda held on tight, I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt

[Pre-Chorus]
The feeling that I'm feeling now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here, 'cause, baby (We belong together)

[Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who else)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who else)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together
 [Verse 2]
I can't sleep at night, when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me, "If you think you're lonely now"
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial, tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface, "I only think of you"
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm feelin' all out of my element
Throwin' things, cryin'
Tryin' to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life)
(We belong together)

[Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby
(We belong together) (Who will?)
[Post-Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me (Who will?)
It's still so hard to believe (Who will?)
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)
Who's gonna talk to me 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

[Outro]
(Who will? Who will? Who will?)
We belong together79

943 - Inside Your Heaven:Carrie Underwood
[Verse 1]
I've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation comin' around
I guess it's right, it's so amazing
Every time I see you, I'm alive

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight (Light)
All my dreams are in your eyes

[Chorus]
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

[Verse 2]
When we touch
When we love
The stars light up, the wrong becomes undone (Done)
 [Pre-Chorus 2]
Naturally, my soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight (Light)
All my dreams are in your eyes

[Chorus]
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

[Bridge]
When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows you away

[Chorus]
I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from (Wanna be inside)
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven1

Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
My baby (y'all know what this is) boy

Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes it'd be like that, baby

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now every time I see you, I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

[Chorus]
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it

Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
But we both know nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it

There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine (We used to shine)

Forever we'd both regret

Late nights, playing in the dark

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms (About us)
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and

[Intro]
My life is brilliant
[Verse 1]
My life is brilliant, my love is pure
I saw an angel, of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan
[Chorus]
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she caught my eye, as I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was, fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

I will never be with you48

Can't come to the phone

'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
(It's ridiculous)
It's been months
And for some reason I just (Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this, yeah (Enough is enough)
No more walking 'round with my head down (Yeah)
I'm so over being blue
Cryin' over you

So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
 [Verse 2]
Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me of what used to be
That's the reason

I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

So done with wishing she were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (Hey)
Why can't I turn off the radio? (Why can't I turn off the radio?)
And I'm so sick of love songs (So sick of love songs)
So tired of tears (And I'm so sick, so sick of love song)
So done with wishing you were still here
(And I'm so sick, so sick of love songs)
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (Hey)
So why can't I turn off the radio?

953 - Bad Day:Daniel Powter
[Verse 1]
Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Verse 2]
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Chorus]
Because you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
 [Verse 3]
Will you need a blue sky holiday?
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Chorus]
You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
(Ooh, a holiday)

[Bridge]
Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well, oh, that strong
And I'm not wrong
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Breakdown]
So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

[Chorus 2]
'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You've seen what you're like
And how does it feel?
One more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

[Outro]
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Had a bad day (Ah)
Had a bad day (ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

(This feels, like, so real) Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressin', incessantly pressin' the issue
'Cause every moment gone, you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close, boy, 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me callin' out for help

This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it

[Verse 2]
Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots and when I see you, it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (Uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels (Over heels)
Boy, you keep me hangin' on, the way you make me feel

This time, please, someone come and rescue me (Someone come and rescue me, yeah)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it

[Bridge]
Boy, you know you got me feelin' open
And boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said, boy, I'm tellin' you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm goin' crazy over you, I'm beggin'

[Chorus]
S-O-S, please, someone help me (Somebody help me, yeah)
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard (Why you makin' this hard for me, baby?)
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night (Ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
This time, please, someone come and rescue me (Someone rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testin' me, but still, I'm losin' it

But you's a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind
I got J.O. up on my right side pourin' some cups
My whole hood is to my left and they ain't givin a fuck
So feel free to get loose and get carried away
So by tomorrow you forgot what you were saying today
But don't forget about this feeling that I am making you get
And all the calories you burn from me making you sweat
The mile-high points you earn when we taking my jet
And how everywhere you turn I'll be making you wet cause you can

And switch it till you running right out of breath
And take a break until you ready again
And you can invite over as many friends as
You want to but I really want you
Just be thankful that Pharrell gave you something to bump to hey
Luda - I'm at the top of my game
You want my hands from your bottom to the top of your frame
And I - just wanna take a little ride on your curves
And get erotic giving your body just what it deserves and
Let me give you some swimming lessons on the penis
Backstroke, breaststroke, stroke of a genius

962 - My Love:Justin Timberlake featuring T.I.
[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my—

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me (What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying "I do")
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Girl, my love, my love
 [Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now If I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure (That, baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin' for (Just say it, "I do")
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Girl, my love, my love
[Interlude: T.I.]
Aight, it's time to get it, JT
I don't know what you hesitatin' for, man
Ay, ay, ay

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Shawty cool as a fan, on the move once again (Ay)
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (Nah)
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When they wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy (Why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire (Haha)
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean? You can't go? Why? (Why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-uh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man...)
Well, baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
St. Bart's, Anguilla, anywhere I chill (Nice)
Just bring with me a pair, I will (C'mon)
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (Love)
My love (Love)
My love (Love)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (Love)
My love (Love)
My love (Love)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Girl, my love, my love44

Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, nigga, please don't touch (Don't touch)

I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable
 [Verse 2]
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Beause you was untrue
Rollin' her 'round in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Frk-frk-down
Hey
You don't mean nothin' at all to me
Hey, hey

[Verse 1: Nelly Furtado]
In the day, in the night
Say it right, say it all

When there's no time for jokin'
There's a hole in the plan

Know that I am alive
And all of what I feel (Feel)
I could show (Show you) you tonight, you tonight
 [Chorus: Nelly Furtado & Timbaland]
Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me (Hey, oh, oh, hey)

Oh, you could mean everything to me (Hey, oh, oh, hey)

[Verse 3: Nelly Furtado]
From my hands I could give you
Something that I made
From my mouth, I could sing you another brick that I laid
From my body (From my body), I could show you (I could show you)
A place (A place) God knows (That only God knows)
You should know the space is holy (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Do you really wanna go?

967 - This Is Why I'm Hot:Mims
[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 1]
This is why I'm hot: I don't gotta rap
I could sell a mill sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say that we lost it so I'ma bring it back
I love the Dirty Dirty 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit the H, I watch 'em get it on the flo'
And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it erryday
Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit L.A
I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way (woo!)
And when I hit the Chi, people say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress, they like my attire
They love how I move crowds from side-to-side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply
 [Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 2]
This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another bitch, another drop
Sixteen bars, twenty-four a pop
Forty-four a song, nigga, gimme what you got
I'm into drivin' cars, fresh up off the lot
I'm into shuttin' stores down just so I could shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me whachu need, you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my homie Black, meet me on the Ave
I hit Wash Heights wit' the money in the bag
We into big spendin', see, my pimpin' never drag
Find me with different women that you niggas never had
For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Player, you come between, you better focus on the beam
I keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean
And when I say I'm hot, my nigga, this is what I mean
[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 3]
This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid and I say "Yeah, I paid a guap"
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way, they call me Cream of the Crop
They hop in the car, I tell 'em "All aboard"
We hit the studio, they say they like how I record
I gave 'em Black Train and I Did You Wrong
So every time I see them, man, they tell me that's they song
They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hangin' from the neck and compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear (Woo!)
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare (Ha!)
Niggas start to hate, rearrange they face
But, little do they know, I keep them things by waist side
I reply "Nobody got to die"
Similar to Lil Weez 'cause I got the fire
[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)12

Ooh, the flossy, flossy

The glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
 [Verse 1: Fergie]
Wear them gold and diamond rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperones and limousines
Shopping for expensive things
I be on the movie screens
Magazines and bougie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine
I still go to Taco Bell
Drive-through, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell
After the show, after the Grammys
I like to go cool out with the family
Sippin' and reminiscin'
On days when I had a Mustang
And now I'm

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I'm talking champagne wishes, caviar dreams
You deserve nothing but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue what to do with us
I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us
Plus I gotta keep enough lettuce to support your shoe fetish
Lifestyle so rich and famous, Robin Leach'll get jealous
Half a million for the stones
Taking trips from here to Rome
So if you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home

[Pre-Chorus: Fergie]
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yes

Ooh, the flossy, flossy
[Bridge: Fergie]
I got problems up to here, I got people in my ear
Telling me these crazy thangs that I don't wanna know (Fuck y'all)
I got money in the bank, and I'd really like to thank
All the fans, I'd like to thank, thank you, really though
'Cause I remember yesterday, when I dreamt about them days
When I'd rock on MTV, that'd be really dope
Damn, it's been a long road, and the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy told me so, he let his daughter know

[Outro: Fergie & (Polow Da Don)]
(If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home, you say it!)
My daddy told me so
("If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home!")
He let his daughter know

My daddy told me so
("If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home!")
He let his daughter know30

Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody thought we'd last forever
I feel I'm hopin' and prayin'
Things between us gon' get better
Men steady comin' after you
Women steady comin' after me
Seems like everybody wanna go for self
And don't wanna respect boundaries

Got every right to wanna go
Got every right to hit the road
And never talk to me no mo'
You don't even have to call
Even check for me at all
'Cause the way I've been actin' lately has been off the wall
Especially towards you, puttin' girls before you
And they watchin' everything I been doin' just to hurt you
Most of it just ain't true and they won't show you
How much of a queen you are to me and why I love you, baby

972 - Makes Me Wonder:Maroon 5
[Verse 1]
Wake up, blood-shot eye
Struggle to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that
Try to get you back

[Pre-Chorus]
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you

[Chorus]
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye

[Verse 2]
God damn my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I've left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth
 [Pre-Chorus]
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you

[Chorus 2]
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no, so this is goodbye

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I've been here before
One day I'll wake up and it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time

And so this is goodbye
[Chorus 2]
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah
And you don't how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no, so this is goodbye

[Outro]

(Oh no) Yeah, so this is goodbye
(Oh no) Yeah, so this is goodbye17

975 - Hey There Delilah:Plain White T's
[Verse 1]
Hey there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight, you look so pretty, yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen, close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

[Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

[Verse 2]
Hey there, Delilah, I know times are gettin' hard
But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar, we'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away, I'd write it all
Even more in love with me, you'd fall
We'd have it all
 [Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

[Bridge]
A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes, and trains, and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never, ever be the same
And you're to blame

[Verse 3]
Hey there, Delilah, you be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school, and I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you
[Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

Three stacks c'mon, now that's three grand
What, you think I'm playin', baby girl?
I'm the man, I invented rubber bands
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a soldier, she ready for Rover

So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover

Sorry but I had to fold her

And every time you think about it, you gon' want some more of me
'Bout to hit the club, make a movie, yeah, rated R
Pulled up like a trap star, that's if you had your regular car
You ever made love to a thug in the club with his ice on?
87 Jeans and a fresh pair of Nikes on
On the couch, on the table, on the bar, or on the floor
You can meet me in the bathroom
Yeah, you know I'm trained to go

[Bridge: Usher]
Might as well give me a kiss
If we keep touching like this
I know you're scared, baby, they don't know what we doing
Let's both get undressed right here
Keep it up, girl, and I swear
I'ma give it to you non-stop
And I don't care who's watching
Watching, watching
In this club, on the floor
Baby, let's make love

984 - Bleeding Love:Leona Lewis
[Intro]
Hey

[Verse 1]
Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen, ooh
But somethin' happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found somethin' true
And everyone's lookin' 'round thinkin' I'm going crazy
Ooh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
You cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
 [Break]
Mm, yeah

[Verse 2]
Tryin' hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercin' sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from fallin', ooh, yeah
But nothin's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
You cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
[Bridge]
And it's drainin' all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearin' these scars for everyone to see

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
Ooh, you cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love (You)
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
Oh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love (You)
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love (Oh, keep bleeding love)
Keep bleedin' (I keep)
Keep, keep bleeding love
Ooh, you cut me open and I
[Outro]
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love

Touch my body, know you like my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve

Then it's gonna leave with me when I do, I do
If there's a camera up in here

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
(Rihanna, let's get it)
So live your life (AYY!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
'Cause I'm a paper chaser
[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

[Sample]
Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha-ha

994 - My Life Would Suck Without You:Kelly Clarkson
[Verse 1]
Guess this means you're sorry
You're standin' at my door
Guess this means you take back
All you said before
Like how much you wanted
Anyone but me
Said you'd never come back

My life (My life) would suck (Would suck)
Without you

995 - Crack a Bottle:Eminem featuring Dr. Dre and 50 Cent
[Intro: Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world, Slim Shady

[Hook: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Ok, let's go
Back with Andre the giant, mister elephant tusk
Fix your must, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fumunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man they love me when I lay in the cutt
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty some paper cut
Now picture us, it's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes
 [Hook]

[Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
They see that low rider go by they're like "Oh my"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cause I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say, I love LA
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

[Hook]

[Eminem]
And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the don
I'm King Kong, get rolled, on wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuana, do what you want
Nigga on and on, till the break of what
Get the paper man, I'm caking, you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want so what I trick
Fat ass Birkin bags, some classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes, I say move a bitch move

[Hook]1

Hey, walk out of the house with my swagger
Hop in, there we go, I got places to go

Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shorties, no nothin' but clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry that's always on gold

My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies

Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my bands
My Benjamin Frank-a-lins
A couple of grands, I got rubberbands
My paper planes making her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We building castles that's made out of sand
She's amazing, her fire blazing, hotter than cajun
Girl, won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belongs on a poster
I'm in a daze, that bottom is waving at me
Like, dammit, I know you
Doing a show like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever then I'll be your chauffeur, 'cause

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down

Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found
It's going down, down

1002 - Fireflies:Owl City
[Verse 1]
You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Bridge]
Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?
 [Verse 3]
To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)
But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Outro]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams95
