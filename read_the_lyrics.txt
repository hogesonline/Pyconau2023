0 - Poor Little Fool:Ricky Nelson
I used to play around with hearts
That hastened at my call
But when I met that little girl
I knew that I would fall

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

She played around and teased me
With her carefree devil eyes
She'd hold me close and kiss me
But her heart was full of lies

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

She told me how she cared for me
And that we'd never part
And so for the very first time
I gave away my heart

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)
 The next day she was gone
And I knew she'd lied to me
She left me with a broken heart
And won her victory

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

Well, I'd played this game with other hearts
But I never thought I'd see
The day that someone else would play
Love's foolish game with me

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(Poor little fool)1

2 - It's All in the Game:Tommy Edwards
Many a tear have to fall
But it's all in the game
All in the wonderful game
That we know as love

You have words with him
And your future's looking dim
But these things
Your hearts can rise above

Once in a while he will call
But it's all in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side
With a sweet bouquet

And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your hearts will fly
Away

(Soon he'll be there at your side)
With a sweet bouquet
Then he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your hearts will fly
Away 

3 - It's Only Make Believe:Conway Twitty
People see us everywhere
They think you really care
But myself, I can't deceive
I know it's only make believe

My one and only prayer
Is that someday you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you

No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe

My hopes, my dreams come true
My life I'd give for you
My heart, a wedding ring
My all, my everything

My heart I can't control
You rule my very soul
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe
 My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you

No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My prayers, my hopes, my schemes
You are my every dream
But it's only make believe (make believe)2

Throughout history, there have been many songs written about the eternal triangle. This next one tells the story of Mister Grayson, a beautiful woman and a condemned man named Tom Dooley. When the sun rises tomorrow, Tom Dooley must hang

Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry

There I took her life
Met her on the mountain
Stabbed her with my knife

[Chorus]
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley
Hang down your head and cry
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley

Hangin' from a white oak tree

6 - Smoke Gets in Your Eyes:The Platters
[Verse 1]
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied, something here inside
Cannot be denied
(Do do do, do do do
Do do do ahh)

They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind, ohhh
When your heart's on fire, you must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

[Verse 2]
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love (Ahh)
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
(Without my love)
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies (Ahh)
Smoke gets in your eyes
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
Smoke gets in your eyes 4

7 - Stagger Lee:Lloyd Price
The night was clear and the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down

I was standing on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
He was barking at the two men who were gambling in the dark
(Da, da, da, da, da, da.) It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw seven, Billy swore that he threw eight

Stagger Lee told Billy, "I can't let you go with that
You have won all my money and my brand new Stetson hat."
(Go, Stagger Lee.)
Stagger Lee went home and he got his forty-four
Said, "I'm going to the barroom just to pay that debt I owe."
(Go, Stagger Lee.) Go on, Stagger Lee!

(Oooh, wah.) Look out there now!
(Oooh, wah.) Come on, Stag, stop playing!
Oooh, wah, oooh, wah, oooh
Ahhh

Stagger Lee went to the barroom
And he stood across the barroom door
Said, "Now nobody move." and he pulled out his forty-four
(Da, da, da, da, da, da.)  "Stagger Lee," cried Billy
"Oh, please don't take my life
I got three little children and a very sickly wife."
(Da, da, da, da, da, da.) Stagger Lee shot Billy
Oh, he shot that poor boy so bad
Till the bullet came through Billy and it broke the bartender's glass
Look out, Stag, go!  (Go, Stagger Lee.)
 (Go, Stagger Lee.  Go, Stagger Lee.) Yeah, do move that!
(Go, Stagger Lee.  Go, Stagger Lee.) Get out there, Stag!
(Go, Stagger Lee.  Go, Stagger Lee.) Oh, please Stagger!
(Go, Stagger Lee.  Go, Stagger Lee.) Come on now, Stag!
Yeah, do move that!  That...Hey!
(Go, Stagger Lee.  Go, Stagger Lee.) Come on, Stag!

11 - The Battle of New Orleans:Johnny Horton
[Verse 1]
In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in a town near New Orleans

[Chorus]
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 2]
We looked down a river
(Hut-two)
And we see'd the British come
(Three-four)
And there must have been a hundred of'em
(Hut-two)
Beatin' on the drums
(Three-four)
They stepped so high
(Hut-two)
And they made their bugles ring
(Three-four)
We stood beside our cotton bales
(Hut-two)
And didn't say a thing
(Two-three-four)
 [Chorus]
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 3]
Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
(One-hut, two-three-four)
If we didn't fire our muskets
(One-hut, two-three-four)
'Till we looked 'em in the eye
(One-hut, two-three-four)
We held our fire
(Hut, two-three-four)
'Till we see their faces well
Then we opened up our squirrel guns
And really gave 'em - well we

[Chorus]
Fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 4]
Yeah, they ran through the briars
(One-hup-two)
And they ran through the brambles
(Hup-two-three-four)
And they ran through the bushes
(Hup-two)
Where the rabbit couldn't go
(Hup-two-three-four)
They ran so fast
(Hup-two)
That the hounds couldn't catch 'em
(One-two-three-four)
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
(One-two, hup-two-three-four)
[Verse 5]
We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fired another round
We filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind

[Chorus]
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 4]
Yeah, they ran through the briars
(Hup-one-two)
And they ran through the brambles
(One-two-three-four)
And they ran through the bushes
(Hup-two)
Where the rabbit couldn't go
(Hup-two-three-four)
They ran so fast
(Hup-two)
That the hounds couldn't catch 'em
(One-two-three-four)
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico1

I'm just a lonely boy
Lonely and blue
I'm all alone
With nothin' to do

I've got everything
You could think of
But all I want
Is someone to love

Someone, yes, someone to love
Someone to kiss
Someone to hold
At a moment like this

I'd like to hear
Somebody say
I'll give you my love
Each night and day

I'm just a lonely boy
Lonely and blue
I'm all alone
With nothin' to do

I've got everything
You could think of
But all I want
Is someone to love
 Somebody, somebody, somebody, please
Send her to me
I'll make her happy
Just wait and see

I've prayed so hard
To the heavens above
That I might find
Someone to love

I'm just a lonely boy
Lonely and blue
I'm all alone
With nothin' to do

I've got everything
You could think of

I got a wishbone in my pocket
I got a rabbit foot around my wrist
You know I'd have all of the things my lucky charms could bring
If you give me just a one sweet kiss
Oh no no no no no no no no
Baby, I ain't asking much of you
Just a big a hunk o' hunk o' hunk o' love will do, that's right

14 - The Three Bells:The Browns
There's a village, hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees, half forlorn
And there, on a sunny morning
Little Jimmy Brown was born

All the chapel bells were ringing
In the little valley town
And the song that they were singing
Was for baby Jimmy Brown

Then the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
"Lead us not into temptation
Bless this hour of meditation
Guide him with eternal love."

There's a village, hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there, twenty years thereafter
Jimmy was to meet his love

All the chapel bells were ringing
'Twas a great day in his life
Cause the song that they were singing
Was for Jimmy and his wife
 Then the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
"Lead us not into temptation
Bless, O Lord, this celebration
May their lives be filled with love."

From the village, hidden deep in the valley
One rainy morning dark and gray
A soul winged its way to Heaven
Jimmy Brown had passed away
Just one lonely bell was ringing
In the little valley town
'Twas farewell that it was singing
To our good old Jimmy Brown

And the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
"Lead us not into temptation
May his soul find the salvation
Of thy great eternal love."

15 - Sleep Walk:Santo & Johnny
Instead of dreaming
I Sleepwalk
Cause I lost you
And now what am I to do
What to do.
Can't believe that we're through
I don't care how much you tell me
Sleep talk
Cause I miss you
While the memory of you
Lingers like a song
Darling, I was so wrong
But I'll be right some day
The night fills my lonely place
I see your face
I know, I miss you so
I still love you
And it drives me insane
Sleepwalk
Every night I just Sleepwalk
And when you walk inside the door
I will Sleepwalk no more
Sleepwalk
Every night I just Sleepwalk
And when you walk inside the door
I will Sleepwalk no more
I will Sleepwalk no more
I will Sleepwalk no more

16 - Mack the Knife:Bobby Darin
Oh the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear
And he shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has old Macheath, babe
And he keeps it outta sight

You know when that shark bites with his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, though, wears ol' Macheath, babe
So there's never, never a trace of red

Now, on the side walk, ooh Sunday morning, uh huh
Lies a body just oozing life, eek
And someone's sneaking 'round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?

There's a tugboat down by the river, don't you know
Where a cement bag's just a-drooping on down
Oh, that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get ya ten, ol' Mackie's back in town

Now did ya hear 'bout Louie Miller? He disappeared, babe
After drawing out all his hard earned cash
And now Macheath spends just like a sailor
Could it be our boy's done something rash?

Now, Jenny Diver, ho ho, Suky Tawdry
Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya and ol' Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms on the right, babe
Now that Mackie's back in town
 I said, Jenny Diver, woah, Suky Tawdry
Look out, Miss Lotte Lenya and ol' Lucy Brown
Yes, that line forms on the right, babe
Now that Mackie's back in town

Look out ol' Mackie is back6

17 - Mr. Blue:The Fleetwoods
[Intro]
Our guardian star lost all his glow the day that I lost you
He lost all his glitter the day you said no, and his silver turned to blue
Like him, I am doubtful that your love is true
But if you decide to call on me, ask for Mr. Blue

[Verse 1]
I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you love me (I'm Mr. Blue)
Then prove it by goin' out on the sly
Provin' your love isn't true
Call me Mr. Blue

[Verse 2]
I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you're sorry (I'm Mr. Blue)
Then turn around, headin' for the lights of town
Hurtin' me through and through
Call me Mr. Blue

[Bridge]
I stay at home at night (I stay at home)
Right by the phone at night (Right by the phone)
But you won't call
And I won't hurt my pride
Call me Mister
 [Verse 3]
I won't tell you
While you paint the town (I'm Mr. Blue)
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm paintin' it, too
But I'm paintin' it blue
Call me Mr. Blue

[Outro]
Call me Mr. Blue
Call me Mr. Blue1

18 - Heartaches by the Number:Guy Mitchell
[Chorus]
Heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less, each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting, that's the day my world will end

[Verse 1]
Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back but never meant to stay

[Chorus]
Yes, I've got
Heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less, each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting, that's the day my world will end

[Verse 2]
Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited, but you must have lost your way

[Chorus]
Yes, I've got
Heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less, each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting, that's the day my world will end 2

20 - Running Bear:Johnny Preston
[Intro]
*vocalizations*

[Verse 1]
On the bank of the river
Stood Running Bear, young Indian brave
On the other side of the river
Stood his lovely Indian maid
Little White Dove was her name
Such a lovely sight to see
But their tribes fought with each other
So, their love could never be

[Chorus]
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die

[Verse 2]
He couldn't swim the raging river
'Cause the river was too wide
He couldn't reach Little White Dove
Waiting on the other side
In the moonlight he could see her
Throwing kisses 'cross the waves
Her little heart was beating faster
Waiting there for her brave
 [Chorus]
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die

[Verse 3]
Running Bear dove in the water
Little White Dove did the same
And they swam out to each other
Through the swirling stream they came
As their hands touched and their lips met
The raging river pulled them down
Now, they'll always be together
In that happy huntin' ground

[Chorus]
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die

That fateful night
The car was stalled
Upon the railroad track
I pulled you out and we were safe
But you went running back

[Chorus]
Teen Angel
Can you hear me?
Teen Angel
Can you see me?
Are you somewhere up above?
And am I still your own true love?

[Verse 2]
What was it you
Were looking for?
That took your life that night
They said they found my high school ring
Clutched in your fingers tight
 [Chorus]
Teen Angel
Can you hear me?
Teen Angel
Can you see me?
Are you somewhere up above?
And am I still your own true love?

22 - Theme from 'A Summer Place':Percy Faith
There's a summer place
Where it may rain or storm
Yet I'm safe and warm
For within that summer place
Your arms reach out to me
And my heart is free from all care
For it knows

There are no gloomy skies
When seen through the eyes
Of those who are blessed with love

And the sweet secret of
A summer place
Is that it's anywhere
When two people share
All their hopes
All their dreams
All their love

And the sweet secret of a summer place
Is that it's anywhere
When two people share
All their hopes
All their dreams, all their love1

Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound

The tears I cried for you could fill an ocean
But you don't care how many tears I cry
And though you only lead me on and hurt me
I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye

Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

Though I'm a fool, at least I know the score
Yet darlin', I'd be twice as blue without you
It hurts, but I come running back for more

Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

And if her love should prove to be untrue
You'll know how much this heart of mine is breakin'
You'll cry for her the way I've cried for you

Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule

I told this heart of mine our love could never be
But then I hear your voice and something stirs inside of me
Somehow I can't dismiss the memory of your kiss
I guess my heart has a mind of its own

[Verse 2]
No matter what I do, no matter what I say
No matter how I try, I just can't turn the other way
When I'm with someone new, I always think of you
I guess my heart has a mind of its own

[Bridge]
You're not in love with me, so why can't I forget?
I'm just your used-to-be, it's wrong, and yet

[Verse 3]
I know forgetting you would be a hopeless thing
For I'm a puppet and I just can't seem to break the string
I say I'll let you go but then my heart says "No"
I guess my heart has a mine of its own
Guess my heart has a mind of its own

37 - Are You Lonesome Tonight?:Elvis Presley
[Verse 1]
Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

[Verse 2]
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?

[Spoken]
I wonder if you are lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage and each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two
You seemed to change, you acted strange
And why, I've never known
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down
 [Outro]
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?5

38 - Wonderland by Night:Bert Kaempfert
Stars hang suspended
Above a floating yellow moon
Two hearts were blended
While angels sang a lover's tune

Not knowing if our hearts would pay the price
But heaven welcomed us to paradise
Blessing our love
Then came the sunrise
Fading the moon and stars from sight

Recalling always
Our wonderland by night

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

[Bridge]
Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night (When the night)
Meets the morning (Meets the morning) sun?

[Verse 3]
I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?

So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me

If you're ever in Alaska stop and see
My cute little Eskimo
Oh, my sweet fraulein down in Berlin town
Makes my heart start to yearn
And my China doll down in old Hong Kong
Waits for my return

Pretty Polynesian baby over the sea
I remember the night
When we walked in the sands of the Waikiki
And I held you oh so tight

Oh, my sweet fraulein down in Berlin town
Makes my heart start to yearn
And my China doll down in old Hong Kong
Waits for my return

Pretty Polynesian baby over the sea
I remember the night
When we walked in the sands of the Waikiki
And I held you oh so tight
 Oh, I'm a travelin' man
Yes, I'm a travelin' man
Yes, I'm a travelin' man
Oh, I'm a travelin' man



46 - Running Scared:Roy Orbison
Just runnin' scared each place we go
So afraid that he might show
Yeah, runnin' scared, what would I do?
If he came back and wanted you
Just runnin' scared, feelin' low
Runnin' scared, you love him so
Just runnin' scared, afraid to lose
If he came back which one would you choose
Then all at once he was standing there
So sure of himself, his head in the air
My heart was breaking, which one would it be
You turned around and walked away with me 1

47 - Moody River:Pat Boone
(Moody river, wooh)
(Moody river, wooh)

Moody river more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody river your muddy water
Took my baby's life

Last Saturday evening
Came to the old oak tree
It stands beside the river
Where you were to meet me

On the ground your glove I found
With a note addressed to me
It read, "Dear love, I've done you wrong
Now I must set you free

No longer can I live
With this hurt and this sin
I just couldn't tell you
That guy was just a friend."

Moody river more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody river your muddy water
Took my baby's life
 I looked into the muddy waters
And what could I see?
I saw a lonely, lonely face just
Lookin' back at me

Tears in his eyes
And a prayer on his lips
And the glove of his lost love
At his finger tips

Moody river more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody river your muddy water
Took my baby's life1

Can't you see, I love you
Please don't break my heart in two

55 - Big Bad John:Jimmy Dean
[Intro]
(Big John)
(Big John)

[Verse 1]
Ev'ry mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood six foot six and weighed two forty five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew, ya didn't give no lip to Big John

[Chorus]
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

[Verse 2]
Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, he kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, he just said, "Hi" to Big John

[Verse 3]
Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the Promised Land, Big John
 [Chorus]
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

[Verse 4]
Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

[Verse 5]
Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant Oak tree, he just stood there alone, Big John

[Chorus]
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

[Verse 6]
And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out, "There's a light up above"
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, Big John
[Verse 7]
With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And as smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John

[Chorus]
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

[Verse 8]
Now they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand
At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man, Big John

[Chorus]
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)3

Soldier boy
Oh my little soldier boy
I'll be true to you

You were my first love
And you'll be my last love
I will never make you blue
I'll be true to you

In the whole world
You can love but one girl
Let me be the one girl
For I'll be true to you

Wherever you go
My heart will follow
I love you so

Take my love with you
To any port or foreign shore
Darling you must feel for sure
And I'll be true to you

65 - I Can't Stop Loving You:Ray Charles
[Chorus]
I can't stop loving you, I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterdays, dreams of yesterday

[Verse 1]
Those happy hours that we once knew
Though long ago, they still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart, yeah

[Chorus]
I can't stop loving you, I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterdays

[Verse 2]
Those happy hours (Those happy hours)
That we once knew (That we once knew)
Though long ago (Though long ago)
Still make me blue (Still make me blue)
They say that time (They say that time)
Heals a broken heart (Heals a broken heart)
But time has stood still (Time has stood still)
Since we've been apart (Since we've been apart)
 [Chorus]
I can't stop loving you, I said I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times, sing the song to me
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life of dreams of yesterdays, of yesterdays2

71 - Monster Mash:Bobby "Boris" Pickett and the Crypt-Kickers
[Verse 1]
I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

[Chorus]
He did the mash, he did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash

[Verse 2]
From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

[Chorus]
They did the mash, they did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They did the mash, it caught on in a flash
They did the mash, they did the monster mash

[Verse 3]
The Zombies were having fun, the party had just begun
The guests included Wolfman, Dracula, and his son
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'
 [Chorus]
They played the mash, they played the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash
They played the mash, they played the monster mash

[Verse 4]
Out from the coffin', Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said
"Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?"
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash

[Verse 5]
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you

[Chorus]
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash
[Outro]
Igor: Mash good!
Mad Scientist: Easy, Igor, you impetuous young boy
Igor: Mash good! Grrr!5

72 - He's a Rebel:The Crystals
See the way he walks down the street
Watch the way he shuffles his feet
My, he holds his head up high
When he goes walking by
He's my guy

When he holds my hand, I'm so proud
'Cause he's not just one of the crowd
Why is he always the one
To try the things they've never done?
Just because of that, they say:

"He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel 'cause he never ever ever does what he should"
But just because he doesn't do what everybody else does
That's no reason why I can't give him all my love
He's always good to me
Always treats me tenderly
'Cause he's not a rebel, no, no, no
He's not a rebel, no, no, no, to me

If they don't like him that way
They won't like me, I'm sure, today
I'll be standing right by his side
When they say:
 "He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel 'cause he never ever ever does what he should"
But just because he doesn't do what everybody else does
That's no reason why we can't share love
He's always good to me
Good to him, I'll try to be
'Cause he's not a rebel, no, no, no
He's not a rebel, no, no, no, to me

Oh he's not a rebel, no, no, no
He's not a rebel, no, no, no

73 - Big Girls Don't Cry:The Four Seasons
Big girls don't cry (they don't cry)
Big girls don't cry (who said they don't cry)
My girl said good-bye (my oh my)
My girl didn't cry (I wonder why)

(Silly boy) Told my girl we had to break up
(Silly boy) Thought that she would call my bluff
(Silly boy) But she said to my surprise
Big girls don't cry

Big girls don't cry (they don't cry)
Big girls don't cry (who said they don't cry)

Baby I was cruel (I was cruel)
Baby I'm a fool (I'm such a fool)

(Silly girl) Shame on you your Mama said
(Silly girl) Shame on you, you cried in bed
(Silly girl) Shame on you, you told a lie
Big girls do cry

Big girls don't cry (they don't cry)
Big girls don't cry (that's just an alibi)

Big girls don't cry [repeat and fade] 1

74 - Go Away Little Girl:Steve Lawrence
Go away, little girl, go away, little girl
I'm not supposed to be alone with you
I know that your lips are sweet
But our lips must never meet
I belong to someone else and I must be true

Oh, go away, little girl, go away, little girl
It's hurtin' me more each minute that you delay
When you are near me like this
You're much too hard to resist
So, go away, little girl, before I beg you to stay

[Unverified] go away
[Unverified] please don't stay
[Unverified] it'll never work out

When you are near me like this
You're much too hard to resist
So, go away, little girl
Call it a day, little girl

Oh, please, go away, little girl
Before I beg you to stay
Go away 1

Our dreams have magic because
We'll always stay
In love this way
Our day will come

81 - If You Wanna Be Happy:Jimmy Soul
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So for my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you

If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So for my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you

A pretty woman makes her husband look small
And very often causes his downfall
As soon as he marries her then she starts
To do the things that will break his heart

But if you make an ugly woman your wife
You'll be happy for the rest of your life
An ugly woman cooks meals on time
She'll always give you peace of mind

If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So for my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you

Don't let your friends say you have no taste
Go ahead and marry anyway
Though her face is ugly, her eyes don't match
Take it from me, she's a better catch
 If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So for my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you

Say man!
Hey baby!
I saw your wife the other day!
Yeah?
Yeah, an' she's ugly!
Yeah, she's ugly, but she sure can cook, baby!
Yeah, alright!

If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So for my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you

If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So for my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you

If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So for my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So for my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you

83 - Easier Said Than Done:The Essex
My friends all tell me
Go to him, run to him
Say sweet lovely things to him
And tell him, he's the one

Deep in my heart I know it
But it's so hard to show it
Cause it's easier, easier said than done

My buddies tell me
Fly to him, sigh to him
Tell him I would die for him
And tell him, he's the one

Although he gives me a feeling
That sets my heart a-reeling
Yet it's easier, easier said than done

Well, I know that I love him so
I'm afraid that he'll never know
Because I (I-I) I get so timid and shy
Each time that I look him in the eye

They all tell me
Sing to him, swing with him
And just do anything for him
And tell him, he's the one
 I got a love so true
But I'm sad and blue
Cause it's easier, easier said than done

Well, I know that I love him so
I'm afraid that he'll never know
Because I (I-I) I get so timid and shy
Each time that I look him in the eye

They all tell me
Sing to him, swing with him
And just do anything for him
And tell him, he's the one

I got a love so true
But I'm sad and blue
Cause it's easier, easier said than done
Easier-er-er-er, said than done

Holding hands, walking all alone
So in love are we two, that we don't know what to do

Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left gone was the glow of
Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears

Precious and warm a memory through the years

106 - The House of the Rising Sun:The Animals
[Refrain]
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one

[Verse 1]
My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he'll be satisfied
Is when he's all drunk

Oh, mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery

The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one103

110 - Leader of the Pack:The Shangri-Las
[Intro: Mary, & Mary-Ann and Margie]
Is she really going out with him?
Well, there she is. Let's ask her
Betty, is that Jimmy's ring you're wearing?
Mhm
Gee, it must be great riding with him
Is he picking you up after school today?
Mnm
By the way, where'd you meet him?
I met him at the candy store
He turned around and smiled at me
You get the picture?
Yes, we see
That's when I fell for the Leader of the Pack

[Verse 1: Mary, & Mary Ann and Margie]
My folks were always putting him down (Down, down)
They said he came from the wrong side of town
(What you mean when you say
That he came from the wrong side of town?)
They told me he was bad
But I knew he was sad
That's why I fell for the Leader of the Pack

[Verse 2: Mary, & Mary Ann and Margie]
One day my Dad said, "Find someone new"
I had to tell my Jimmy, "We're through"
(What you mean when you say
That you better go find somebody new?)
He stood there and asked me why
But all I could do was cry
I'm sorry I hurt you, the Leader of the Pack
 [Bridge: Mary, & Mary Ann and Margie]
He sort of smiled and kissed me goodbye
The tears were beginning to show
As he drove away on that rainy night
I begged him to go slow
Whether he heard, I'll never know

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Look out, look out, look out, look out!

[Verse 3: Mary, & Mary Ann and Margie]
I felt so helpless, what could I do?
Remembering all the things we've been through
In school they all stop and stare
I can't hide my tears, but I don't care
I'll never forget him, the Leader of the Pack

[Outro (Fade): Mary, & Mary Ann and Margie]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
(Leader of the Pack, and now he's gone)
(Leader of the Pack, and now he's gone)
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
(Leader of the Pack, and now he's gone)
(Leader of the Pack, and now he's gone)
Gone, gone, gone, gone...2

111 - Ringo:Lorne Greene
[Intro]
They lie in boothills all through the West
The outlaws, the gunslingers, the Billy the Kids and worse
Say a fella like the coward that shot Bill Hickock in the back
There's always one like that in every time of history
Most of them were varmints
But every once in a while in one of them
There may have lived a man

[Verse 1]
He lay face down in the desert sand
Clutching his six-gun in his hand
Shot from behind, I thought he was dead
For under his heart was an ounce of lead
But a spark still burned so I used my knife
And late that night I saved the life of Ringo
(Ringo, Ringo)

[Verse 2]
I nursed him 'til the danger passed
The days went by, he mended fast
And then from dawn 'til setting sun
He practiced with that deadly gun
And hour on hour I watched in awe
No human being could match the draw of Ringo
(Ringo, Ringo)
 [Verse 3]
One day we rode the mountain crest
And I went East, and he went West
I took to law and wore a star
While he spread terror, near and far
With lead and blood he gained such fame
All through the West they feared the name of Ringo
(Ringo, Ringo)

[Verse 4]
I knew someday I'd face the test
Which one of us would be the best
And sure enough the word came down
That he was holed up in the town
I left the posse out in the street
And I went in alone to meet Ringo
(Ringo, Ringo)

[Verse 5]
They said my speed was next to none
But my lightning draw had just begun
When I heard a blast that stung my wrist
The gun went flying from my fist
And I was looking down the bore
Of the deadly .44 of Ringo
(Ringo, Ringo)
[Verse 6]
They say that was the only time
That anyone had seen him smile
He slowly lowered his gun and then
He said to me "We're even, friend"
And so at last I understood
That there was still a spark of good in Ringo
(Ringo, Ringo)

[Verse 7]
I blocked the path of his retreat
He turned and stepped into the street
A dozen guns spit fire and lead
A moment later, he lay dead
The town began to shout and cheer
Nowhere was there shed a tear for Ringo
(Ringo)

[Outro]
The story spread throughout the land
That I had beaten Ringo's hand
And it was just the years, they say
That made me put my guns away
But on his grave they can't explain
The tarnished star above the name of Ringo
(Ringo, Ringo)
(Ringo, Ringo)

112 - Mr. Lonely:Bobby Vinton

Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely

[Chorus]
Now I'm a soldier, a lonely soldier
Away from home through no wish of my own
That's why I'm lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I wish that I could go back home

[Verse 2]
Letters, never a letter
I get no letters in the mail
I've been forgotten, yes, forgotten
Oh, how I wonder, how is it I failed

[Chorus]
Now I'm a soldier, a lonely soldier
Away from home through no wish of my own
That's why I'm lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I wish that I could go back home 6

113 - Come See About Me:The Supremes

To ease the fire that within me burns

It keeps me crying baby for you
Keeps me sighin' baby for you

Sometime's down (ooh, ooh)

With you not around (ooh, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
From my arms you maybe out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep

Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty

Each time you leave my door

Knowing your other love you'll meet

After I've been good to you

Worth more than my love and affection?

And rush off to her charms
(Think it over)
Haven't I been good to you?

Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground

133 - Eve Of Destruction:Barry McGuire
[Verse 1]
The Eastern world, it is explodin'
Violence flarin', bullets loadin'
You're old enough to kill, but not for votin'
You don't believe in war, but what's that gun you're totin'?
And even the Jordan River has bodies floatin'

[Chorus]
But you tell me over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

[Verse 2]
Don't you understand what I'm tryin' to say?
And can't you feel the fears I'm feelin' today?
If the button is pushed, there's no runnin' away
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave
Take a look around you, boy, it's bound to scare you, boy

[Chorus]
And you tell me over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction
[Verse 3]
Yeah, my blood's so mad, feels like coagulatin'
I'm sittin' here just contemplatin'
I can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation
Handful of senators don't pass legislation
And marches alone can't bring integration
When human respect is disintegratin'
This whole crazy world is just too frustratin'
 [Chorus]
And you tell me over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

[Verse 4]
Think of all the hate there is in Red China
Then take a look around to Selma, Alabama
Ah, you may leave here, for four days in space
But when you return, it's the same old place
The poundin' of the drums, the pride and disgrace
You can bury your dead, but don't leave a trace
Hate your next-door neighbor, but don't forget to say grace

[Chorus]
And tell me over and over and over and over again, my friend
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction
No, no, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction8

[Verse 1]
I live on an apartment
On the ninety-ninth floor of my block
And I sit at home looking out the window
Imagining the world has stopped
Then in flies a guy
Who's all dressed up just like the Union Jack
Says, I've won five pounds
If I have his kind of detergent pack

[Chorus]
I said, "Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud, baby"

[Verse 2]
The telephone is ringing
I say, "Hi, it's me, who is it there on the line?"
A voice says, "Hi, hello, how are you?"
Well, I guess I'm doing fine
It's three AM, there's too much noise
Don't you people ever want to go to bed?
Just because you feel so good
Do you have to drive me out of my head?
 [Chorus]
I said, "Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud, baby"
Yeah

[Verse 3]
I was sick and tired, fed up with this
So I decided to take a drive downtown
It was so very quiet and peaceful
There was nobody, not a soul around
I laid myself out
I was so tired and I started to dream
In the morning the parking tickets were just like flags
Stuck on my windscreen

[Chorus]
I said, "Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud,"

[Outro]

Don't hang around, baby, two's a crowd
On my cloud

136 - I Hear a Symphony:The Supremes
You've given me a true love
And every day I thank you, love
For a feeling that's so new
So inviting, so exciting

Whenever you're near, I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Pulling me closer, closer to your arms
Then suddenly (I hear a symphony)
Ooh, your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine
Till I leave the past behind
I'm lost in a world
Made for you and me

Whenever you're near, I hear a symphony
Play sweet and tenderly
Every time your lips meet mine, now, baby, baby, baby
You bring much joy within
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on, now, baby, baby, baby
Those tears that fill my eyes
I cry not for myself
But for those who've never felt the joy we felt (baby)

Whenever you're near, I hear a symphony
Each time you speak to me
I hear a tender rhapsody of love now, baby, baby
As you stand holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air, now, baby, baby
Don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
Ooh, so close to me, baby, baby, baby, baby
I hear a symphony
A tender melody 1

My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine

My love is deeper than the deepest ocean
Wider than the sky
My love is brighter than the brightest star
That shines every night above
And there is nothing in this world
That can ever change my love

Something that I never felt before
You are always on my mind, no matter what I do

My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine
Softer than a sigh
My love is deeper than the deepest ocean
Wider than the sky
My love is brighter than the brightest star
That shines every night above
And there is nothing in this world
That can ever change my love

141 - Lightnin' Strikes:Lou Christie
Listen to me, baby
You gotta understand
You're old enough to know the makings of a man

Listen to me, baby
It's hard to settle down
Am I asking too much for you to stick around

Every boy wants a girl
He can trust to the very end
Baby, that's you
Won't you wait but 'til then

When I see lips begging to be kissed (stop)
I can't stop (stop)
I can't stop myself
(Stop, stop)

Lightning is striking again
Lightning is striking again
Nature's taking over my one-track mind

Believe it or not
You're in my heart all the time
All the girls are saying that you'll end up a fool
 For the time being, baby, live by my rules
When I settle down
I want one baby on my mind
Forgive and forget
And I'll make up for all lost time
If she's put together fine

And she's readin' my mind (stop)
I can't stop (stop)
I can't stop myself
(Stop, stop)

Lightning is striking again
Lightning is striking again
And again and again and again

[Instrumental]

Lightning is striking again
Lightning is striking again

There's a chapel in the pines
Waiting for us around the bend
Picture in your mind
Love forever, but 'til then
If she gives me a sign
That she wants to make time (stop)
I can't stop (stop)
I can't stop myself
(Stop, stop)

Lightning is striking again
Lightning is striking again
And again and again and again

Lightning is striking again
And again and again and again1

[Verse 1]
Fighting soldiers from the sky
Fearless men who jump and die
Men who mean just what they say
The brave men of the Green Beret

Silver wings upon their chest

But only three win the Green Beret

Trained in combat hand to hand
Men who fight by night and day
Courage take from the Green Beret

But only three win the Green Beret

Her Green Beret has met his fate
He had died for those oppressed
Leaving her this last request

Put silver wings on my son's chest
Make him one of America's best
He'll be a man they'll test one day
Have him win the Green Beret

147 - When A Man Loves A Woman:Percy Sledge
When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down

When a man loves a woman
He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playin' him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see
 When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong
He can never want
Some other girl

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
Cause baby, baby, you're my world

When a man loves a woman...6

148 - Paint It Black:The Rolling Stones
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

[Verse 2]
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

[Verse 3]
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

[Verse 4]
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes
 [Verse 5]
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

[Outro]
I wanna see it painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted
Painted black, yeah85

Hot town, summer in the city
Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty

Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around, people looking half-dead
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head

Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on, and dance all night

Running up the stairs, gonna meet you on the rooftop

Sunshine came softly through my a-window today

[Intro]
I need love, love
To ease my mind
I need to find, find
Someone to call mine
But Mama said

[Chorus]
"You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take" (Can't wait)
"You can't hurry love (Ooh, until that day)
No, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time (Love don't come easy)
No matter how long it takes"

[Verse 1]
But how many heartaches
Must I stand
Before I find a love
To let me live again?
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Yeah, is almost gone
I remember Mama said
 [Chorus]
"(You can't hurry love)
No, you just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take" (Can't wait)
How long must I wait? (Ooh, until that day)
How much more can I take
Before loneliness (Love don't come easy)
Will cause my heart, heart to break?

[Verse 2]
No I can't bear
To live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love
To call my own
But when I feel that I
I can't go on
These precious words
Keeps me hangin' on
I remember Mama said

[Chorus]
"(You can't hurry love)
No, you just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take" (Can't wait)

She said, "Trust, give it time (Love don't come easy)
No matter how long it takes"

No, love, love
Don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating
For that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight

[Chorus]
I keep waiting (Can't wait, ooh, until that day)
I keep on waiting
But it ain't easy (Love don't come easy)
It ain't easy, but Mama said
"You can't hurry love (Ooh, until that day)
No, you just have to wait"
She said, "Trust, give it time (Love don't come easy)
No matter how long it takes"

She said love don't come easy"3

All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside

[Chorus]
You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could mold you Into someone who could cherish me as much as I cherish you

[Verse 2]
Perish is a word that more than applies
To the hope in my heart each time I realize

When I am not gonna be the one to share your schemes
When I am not gonna be the one to share what seems
To be the life that you could cherish as much as I do yours

Oh, I'm beginnin' to think that man has never found
The words that could make you want me
That have the right amount of letters, just the right sound
That could make you hear, make you see
That you are drivin' me out of my mind
Oh, I could say I need you, but then you'd realize
That I want you just like a thousand other guys
Who'd say they love you with all the rest of their lies
When all they wanted was to touch your face, your hands
And gaze into your eyes
 [Verse 1]
Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside

[Chorus]
You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could mold you
Into someone who could cherish me as much as I cherish you

Cherish you

Cherish you

161 - You Keep Me Hangin' On:The Supremes
[Chorus]
Set me free, why don'tcha, baby?
Get out my life, why don'tcha, baby?
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hanging on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hanging on

[Verse 1]
Why do you keep a-coming around
Playing with my heart?
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me make a new start?
Letting me get over you
The way you've gotten over me, hey

[Chorus]
Set me free, why don't cha, baby?
Let me be, why don't cha, baby? (Ooh-woo, ooh)
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hanging on (Ooh-woo, ooh)
Now, you don't really want me
You just keep me hanging on

[Verse 2]
You say, although we broke up
You still wanna be just friends
But how can we still be friends
When seeing you only breaks my heart again?
And there ain't nothin' I can do about it
 [Chorus]
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Set me free, why don't cha, baby?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Get out my life, why don't cha baby? (Ooh-woo, ooh)
Set me free, why don'tcha, baby?
Get out my life, why don'tcha, baby?

[Verse 3]
You claim you still care for me
But your heart and soul needs to be free
And now that you've got your freedom
You wanna still hold on to me
You don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else, hey-ey

[Chorus]
Why don't you be a man about it
And set me free? (Ooh-woo, ooh)
Now, you don't care a thing about me
You're just using me (Ooh-woo, ooh)
Go on, get out, get out of my life
And let me sleep at night, please (Ooh-woo, ooh)
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hanging on

Winchester Cathedral
You're bringing me down
You stood and you watched as
My baby left town

164 - I'm a Believer:The Monkees
[Verse 1]
I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else, but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

[Chorus 1]
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried

Seems the more I gave, the less I got
What's the use in tryin'?
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine, I got rain

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried

She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
While the sun is bright, or in the darkest night
No one knows, she comes and goes
[Chorus]
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained to a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost, at such a cost

Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

"Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time, lose your dreams and you
Will lose your mind, ain't life unkind?"

When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

Still I'm going to miss you

167 - Love Is Here and Now You're Gone:The Supremes
[Verse 1]
Love is here (Love is here), and oh, my darling
Now you're gone (Now you're gone)
Love is here (Love is here), and oh, my darling
Now, now you're gone (Now you're gone)
You persuaded me to love you and I did
But instead of tenderness, I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell, so unaware
Of the loneliness that was waitin' there

[Chorus 1]
(Look what you've done)
You closed the door to your heart
(Look what you've done)
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me

[Verse 2]
Love is here (Love is here), and oh, my darlin'
Now you're gone (Now you're gone)
You made me love you (You made me love you)
And oh, my darlin', now you're gone (Now you're gone)
You said lovin' you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked, just walked away
 [Chorus 2]
(Look what you've done)
You stripped me of my dreams
(Look what you've done)
You gave me faith, then took my hope
Look at me now

[Verse 3]
Look at me, see what lovin' you has done to me
Look at my face (Look at my face)
See how cryin' has left its trace (Left its trace)
After you made me all your own (Made me all your own)
Then you left me all alone (Left me all alone)
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep

[Chorus 3]
(Look what you've done)
My heart cries out for your touch
(Look what you've done)
But you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

[Verse 4]
Love is here (Love is here), and oh, my darlin'
Now you're gone (Now you're gone)
Love is here (Love is here), and oh, my darlin'

168 - Penny Lane:The Beatles
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus: Paul McCartney with John Lennon & George Harrison]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

[Piccolo Trumpet Solo]
 [Chorus: Paul McCartney with John Lennon & George Harrison]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

[Verse 5: Paul McCartney]
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus: Paul McCartney with John Lennon & George Harrison]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

[Chorus: Paul McCartney with John Lennon & George Harrison]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane25

170 - Somethin' Stupid:Nancy Sinatra and Frank Sinatra
[Verse 1: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me

[Refrain: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

[Bridge: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

[Verse 2: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you

[Refrain: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

171 - The Happening:The Supremes
[Verse 1]
Hey, life, look at me
I can see the reality
'Cause when you shook me, took me out of my world
I woke up
Suddenly I just woke up to the happening
When you find that you left the future behind
'Cause when you got a tender love
You don't take care of
Then you better beware of the happening

[Chorus]
One day you're up, then you turn around
You find your world is tumbling down
It happened to me, and it can happen to you

[Verse 2]
I was sure, I felt secure
Until love took a detour
Yeah, riding high on top of the world
It happened, suddenly it just happened
I saw my dreams fall apart
When love walked away from my heart
And when you lose that precious love you need
To guide you
Something happens inside you, the happening
 [Chorus]
Now I see life for what it is
It's not all dreams, ooh, it's not all bliss
It happened to me and it can happen to you

[Bridge]
Once
Ooh, and then it happened
Ooh, and then it happened
Ooh, and then it happened
Ooh, and then it happened

[Verse 3]
Is it real, is it fake
Is this game of life a mistake?
'Cause when I lost the love I thought was mine
For certain, suddenly I started hurting
I saw the light too late
When that fickle finger of fate
Yeah, came and broke my pretty balloon
I woke up
Suddenly I just woke up to the happening

[Chorus]
So sure, I felt secure
Until love took a detour
'Cause when you got a tender love you don't
Take care of, then you better beware of1

176 - Ode to Billie Joe:Bobbie Gentry
[Verse 1]
Was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton, and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door, "Y'all, remember to wipe your feet!"
And then she said, "I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today, Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

[Verse 2]
And Papa said to Mama, as he passed around the black-eyed peas
"Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please
There's five more acres in the lower forty I got to plow"
And Mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

[Verse 3]
And brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
"I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

[Verse 4]
Mama said to me, "Child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all mornin', and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billie Joe was throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge"
 [Verse 5]
A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus goin' 'round; Papa caught it, and he died last spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge13

178 - To Sir With Love:Lulu
[Verse 1]
Those schoolgirl days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind
I know they will still live on and on, and on

[Pre-Chorus]
But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try
I'll try

[Chorus]
If you wanted the sky
Write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
"To Sir, with love"

[Verse 2]
The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend

[Pre-Chorus]
A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong, that's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return?
Oh, oh
 [Chorus]
If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To Sir, with love
If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To Sir, with love1

179 - Incense and Peppermints:Strawberry Alarm Clock
[Intro]
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba

[Verse 1]
Good sense, innocence, cripplin' mankind
Dead kings, many things I can't define
Occasions, persuasions clutter your mind
Incense and peppermints, the color of time

[Chorus]
Who cares what games we choose?
Little to win, but nothin' to lose

[Bridge]
Incense and peppermints, meaningless nouns
Turn on, tune in, turn your eyes around
Look at yourself, look at yourself, yeah, girl
Look at yourself, look at yourself, yeah, girl, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
To divide the cockeyed world in two
Throw your pride to one side, it's the least you can do
Beatniks and politics, nothin' is new
A yardstick for lunatics, one point of view
 [Chorus]
Who cares what games we choose?
Little to win, but nothin' to lose

[Verse 3]
Good sense, innocence, cripplin' mankind
Dead kings, many things I can't define
Occasions, persuasions clutter your mind
Incense and peppermints, the color of time

[Chorus]
Who cares what games we choose?
Little to win, but nothin' to lose

[Verse 1]
Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
Of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring

[Chorus]
Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen?

You once thought of me
As a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh, and our good times starts and end
Without dollar one to spend
But how much, baby, do we really need

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer

185 - Honey:Bobby Goldsboro
See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it, was just a twig

Then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago

And it would sure embarrass her
When I came in from workin' late
Cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there and cryin'
Over some sad and silly late, late show

And honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could
 She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly
And caught her cryin' needlessly
In the middle of the day
And it was in the early Spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away
And honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

One day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone
The angels came
Now all I have is memories of Honey
And I wake up nights and call her name

Now my life's an empty stage
Where Honey lived and Honey played
And love grew up
And a small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed
That Honey loved
And see the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
And I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it, was just a twig1

Every way you look at it, you lose

Do you hope to make her see, you fool?
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you all a story
About a Harper Valley widowed wife
Who had a teenage daughter
Who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well, her daughter came home one afternoon
And didn't even stop to play
And she said, "Mom, I got a note here
From the Harper Valley PTA"

[Verse 2]
Well the note said, "Mrs. Johnson
You're wearin' your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinking
And a-running round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be
A-bringin' up your little girl this way"
And it was signed by the Secretary
Harper Valley PTA

[Verse 3]
Well, it happened that the PTA
Was gonna meet that very afternoon
And they were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson
Wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard
I can still recall the words she had to say
She said, "I'd like to address this meeting
Of the Harper Valley PTA"
 [Verse 4]
"Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there
And seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice
Whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker can you tell us why
Your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down?"

[Verse 5]
"Well, Mr Harper couldn't be here
'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath
You'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me
You think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Peyton Place
And you're all Harper Valley hypocrites"

[Outro]
No, I wouldn't put you on because it really did
It happened just this way
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA4

193 - Love Child:Diana Ross & the Supremes
[Intro]
(Tenement slum
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
You think that I don't feel love (I'll always love you)
But what I feel for you is real love
In those eyes, I see reflected (I'll always love you)
A hurt, scorned, rejected (Love you)

[Hook]
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me

[Verse 1]
Started my life in an old, cold, rundown tenement slum (Tenement slum)
My father left, he never even married Mom
I shared the guilt my mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, this love we're contemplating (I'll always love you)
Is worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating (I'll always love you)
The child we may be creating (Love you)
 [Hook]
Love child, never meant to be (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Love child, (Scorned by) Society
Love child, always second best (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Love child, (Different from) Different from the rest

[Post-Chorus]
(Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby
(Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby

[Verse 2]
I started school in a worn, torn dress that somebody threw out (Somebody threw out)
I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, don't think that I don't need you (I'll always love you)
Don't think I don't wanna please you
But no child of mine will be bearing (I'll always love you)
The name of shame I've been wearing (Love you)

[Hook]
Love child, love child, never quite as good (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood (Just a little bit longer, love child)
But I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)
I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)
I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)

You, you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)
Always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
You (Just a little bit longer, love child)
You (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)
Take a look, take a look at me (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Love child, love child (Just a little bit longer, love child)
I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)1

194 - I Heard It Through the Grapevine:Marvin Gaye
[Verse 1]
Ooh-ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)

[Verse 2]
I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears, I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life, you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else
Instead
 [Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)

[Verse 3]
People say believe half of what you see
Son, and none of what you hear
But I can't help being confused
If it's true please tell me, dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?
Don't you know

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
I heard it through the grapevine
Ooh, I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)

[Outro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honey, honey, I know (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)

Ooh, heard it through the grapevine (Yeah, yeah, yeah)8

196 - Everyday People:Sly and the Family Stone
[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in

[Chorus]
I am everyday people, yeah, yeah

[Bridge 1]
There is a blue one who can't accept the green one
For living with a fat one, trying to be a skinny one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee

[Refrain]
Ooh, sha sha
We got to live together

[Verse 2]
I am no better and neither are you
We are the same whatever we do
You love me, you hate me, you know me and then
You can't figure out the bag I'm in

[Chorus]
I am everyday people, yeah, yeah
 [Bridge 2]
There is a long hair that doesn't like the short hair
For being such a rich one, that will not help the poor one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee

[Refrain]
Ooh, sha sha
We got to live together

[Bridge 3]
There is a yellow one that won't accept the black one
That won't accept the red one, that won't accept the white one
Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee

[Outro Chorus]
Ooh, sha sha
I am everyday people1

197 - Dizzy:Tommy Roe
Dizzy
I'm so dizzy my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you, girl, making it spin
You're making me dizzy

First time that I saw you, girl
I knew that I just had to make you mine
But it's so hard to talk to you
With fellas hanging 'round you all the time

I want you for my sweet pet
But you keep playing hard to get
I'm going around in circles all the time

Dizzy
I'm so dizzy my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you, girl, making it spin
You're making me dizzy

I finally got to talk to you
And I told you just exactly how I felt
Then I held you close to me
And kissed you and my heart began to melt
 Girl, you've got control on me
'Cause I'm so dizzy I can't see
I need to call a doctor for some help

Dizzy
I'm so dizzy my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you, girl, making it spin
You're making me dizzy, my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool it never ends
And it's you girl making it spin

You're making me dizzy
You're making me dizzy
I'm so dizzy
You're making me dizzy

199 - Get Back:The Beatles with Billy Preston
[Verse 1:]
I can describe my rivals with a single word: unimpressive
Evaluate your own shortcomings, I'm done assessin'
Beatles on the rooftop, I'm a public blessin'
They feed us Elvis Presley while we needin' Billy Preston
Get Back to bling and Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It
I'm local, you're not in the scene, you ain't hot wit it
I leave 'em stupefied, you leave 'em in a lifeless stupor
You don't ride for your city just 'cause you drive for Uber
And you ain't stackin' a stupid amount in salaries
I'm gettin' fat from refusal of countin' calories
My waistline is on some ramen embrace time
I'm still iconic as a Chili Peppers bassline

[Hook:]
Two little devils try to whisper in my ear
What I do might depend on which one that I hear
One is tellin' me, "play the nice guy for a while"
While the other's sayin' "save your energy, don't ever smile"
Ultimatum!
These fishes takin' the bait until I fileted 'em
No more chickens are cluckin' after I ate 'em

[Verse 2:]
So go and make your thesis claim
You pick my pronoun! Say he or they or she's insane
I keep it low down, you feel it when the speakers shake
We keep it deep as tectonics, so you can pass the plate
That's my state, we eatin' but you may have to wait
These SNAP benefits barely gettin' us half the way
Social services gettin' harder to navigate
Repudiate the civic duty that they abdicate
And if they make ya take a UA for food stamps
Drop a doody in the urine cup right out the gate
I bet they still say "Let's take it to the lab and wait"
The troubles of our government, need I elaborate?
Beat from Croz K, formerly Odar
We makin' inroads like reformin' the ODOT
Came a long way from that Minnesota
You found an Oregonian who has better flow? Nah!
The prime product, my lines brought up by high scholars
So defy logic and try and stop it, I'll grind harder
Still in school for the Masters
They knew I'd do it when I took my name from a math term
Been half-assin', skatin' by, no half-pipin'
Dopest rapper in Oregon, time to act like it
But I ain't take a single bit of good for granted
I'm never bitter, gotta get up when abandoned
Ain't no need to be chronicling bumps and bruises
If you were smeared in college by fuckin' losers
In 8th grade the worst post was "you're gay"
Now we seein' our friends' failings in 4K!
But let 'em hate you, 'cause nobody has to like you
I got 'em like "Who the hell did we pass the mic 2?"

200 - In the Year 2525:Zager and Evans
[Chorus 1]
In the year 2525
If man is still alive
If woman can survive
They may find-

[Chorus 2]
In the year 3535
Ain't gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lies
Everything you think, do, and say
Is in the pills you took today

[Chorus 3]
In the year 4545
Ain't gonna need your teeth, won't need your eyes
You won't find a thing to chew
Nobody's gonna look at you

[Chorus 4]
In the year 5555
Your arms are hanging limp at your sides
Your legs got nothing to do
Some machine's doing that for you

[Chorus 5]
In the year 6565
Ain't gonna need no husband, won't need no wife
You'll pick your sons, pick your daughters too
From the bottom of a long glass tube
Whoa-oh-oh
 [Chorus 6]
In the year 7510
If God's a-coming, he ought to make it by then
Maybe he'll look around himself and say
"Guess it's time for the judgement day!"

[Chorus 7]
In the year 8510
God is gonna shake his mighty head
He'll either say, "I'm pleased, where man has been"
Or tear it down and start again
Whoa-oh-oh

[Chorus 8]
In the year 9595
I'm kinda wonderin', if man is gonna be alive
He's taken everything this old Earth can give
And he ain't put back nothing
Whoa-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Now it's been ten thousand years
Man has cried a billion tears
For what he never knew
Now man's reign is through
But through the eternal night
The twinkling of starlight
So very far away
Maybe it's only yesterday
[Chorus 1]
In the year 2525
If man is still alive
If woman can survive
They may find

[Chorus 2]
In the year 3535
Ain't gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lies...

201 - Honky Tonk Women:The Rolling Stones
[Verse 1]
I met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across her shoulder

[Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women
That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

[Verse 2]
I laid a divorcee in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then she covered me in roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind

[Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women
That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

[Verse 3]
Strollin' on the boulevards of Paris
Naked as the day that I will die
The sailors, they're so charming there in Paris
But I just don't seem to sail you off my mind
 [Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women
That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

It's the honky tonk women
That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues7

I just can't believe the wonder of this feeling, too

Ah sugar, ah honey honey
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you
Ah honey, ah sugar sugar
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you

When I kissed you, girl, I knew how sweet a kiss could be
(I know how sweet a kiss can be)
Like the summer sunshine pour your sweetness over me
(Pour your sweetness over me)
 [Pre-Chorus]
Sugar, pour a little sugar on it honey
Pour a little sugar on it baby
I'm gonna make your life so sweet, yeah yeah yeah
Pour a little sugar on it oh yeah
Pour a little sugar on it honey
Pour a little sugar on it baby

Pour a little sugar on it honey

[Intro]
Hold it, everybody
Hold it, hold it
Listen ...

[Verse 1]
I can turn the greyest sky blue
I can make it rain whenever I want it to
Oh, I can build a castle from a single grain of sand
I can make a ship sail high on dry land

But my life is incomplete, and I'm so blue

Ooh
Ooh
Chicka boom, chicka boom
Chicka boom, boom, boom

[Verse 3]
I can turn back the hands of time, you better believe I can
I can make the seasons change just by waving my hand
Oh, I can change anything from old to new
The things I want to do the most, I'm unable to do

[Bridge 2]
Unhappy am I with all the powers I possess
'Cause, girl, you're the key to my happiness
And I, oh I can't get next to you

[Chorus]
Girl, you're blowing my mind
'Cause I can't get (next to you)
Can't you see these tears I'm crying?
I can't get (next to you)
Girl, it's you that I need
I gotta get (next to you)
Can't you see these tears I'm crying?
I can't get (next to you)

We're caught in a trap, I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see what you're doin' to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

[Chorus]
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (With suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

[Verse 2]
So if an old friend I know stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again, asking where I've been
You can't see the tears are real, I'm cryin' (Yes, I'm cryin')

[Verse 1]
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
I'm standin' here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breakin' it's early morn
The taxi's waitin', he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could cry

So kiss me and smile for me

Hold me like you'll never let me go

I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

[Verse 2]
There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around

Every song I sing I sing for you
When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring (I'll wear your ring)

[Chorus]
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go

210 - Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head:B. J. Thomas
Raindrops are falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothing seems to fit
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling
So I just did me some talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleeping on the job
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling
But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me
Won't defeat me, it won't be long
Till happiness steps up to greet me
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me

211 - I Want You Back:The Jackson 5
[Intro: Michael Jackson]
Uh-huh huh huh huh
Let me tell ya now
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now, it's much too late for me to take a second look

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Jackson 5]
Oh, baby, give me one more chance (To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (Let you go, baby)
But now, since I see you in his arms (I want you back)

[Post-Chorus: Michael Jackson & Jackson 5]
Yes, I do now (I want you back)
Ooh, ooh, baby (I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back)
Na, na, na, na

218 - Everything Is Beautiful:Ray Stevens
[Chorus:]
Jesus loves the little children
All the little children of the world
Red and yellow, black and white
They are precious in his sight
Jesus loves the little children of the world

Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer night
Or a snow covered winter's day

Everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way

[Verse 1:]
There is none so blind
That is he who will not see
We must not close our minds
We must let our thought be free
For every hour that passes by

You know the world
Gets a little bit older
It's time to realize
That beauty lies
In the eyes of the beholder
 [Chorus:]
Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer nights
Or a snow covered winter's day
Ah, sing it, children

Everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way

[Verse 2:]
We shouldn't care
About the length of his hair
Or the color of his skin
Don't worry about what shows from without
But the love that lives within
We're gonna get it all together now

Everything gonna work out fine
Just take a little time
To look on the good side my friend
And straighten it out in your mind

[Chorus:]
Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer nights
Or a snow covered winter's day
Ah, sing it, children
Everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way

One more time
Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer nights

The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know
The many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door
But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here
Lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

220 - The Love You Save:The Jackson 5
[Intro]
Stop! Na na na! You'd better save it
Stop, stop, stop, you'd better save it

[Verse 1]
When we played tag in grade school
You wanted to be it
But chasing boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart you'd quit

When we grew up, you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now, just like back to grade school
You're doing the same old thing

[Chorus]
Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or someday, you'll be all alone
You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for a danger zone

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one you need
Those other guys will put you down
As soon as they succeed
 They'll ruin your reputation
They'll label you a flirt
The way they talk about you
They'll turn your name to dirt, oh

[Verse 2]
Isaac said he kissed you
Beneath the apple tree
When Benji held your hand he felt
Electricity

When Alexander called you
He said he rang your chime
Christopher discovered
You're way ahead of your time

[Chorus]
Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or someday, you'll be all alone
You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for a danger zone

[Bridge]
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
S is for "Save it"
T is for "Take it slow"
O is for "Oh, no!"
P is for "Please, please, don't go!"

[Outro]
The love you save may be your own
Some day, you may be all alone
Stop it
Save it, girl
Baby! Ooh

You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own
Please, please
Or someday, someday, baby, you'll be all alone

I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one you need
Those other guys will put you down as soon as they succeed

Stop! The love you save may be your own, baby
You'd better stop it, stop it, stop it, girl
Or someday, you'll be all alone

The way they talk about you
They'll turn your name, turn your name to dirt
Stop! The love you save may be your own!
Don't 'cha know, don't 'cha know
Someday, baby, you'll be all alone
Wait a while
Those other guys will put you down as soon as they succeed7

Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Wa, close to you

No, you don't know me well
And every little thing, only time will tell

Love can be right or wrong
And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through

Say it again, y'all!
(War, huh) Lookout!
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing

'Cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War means tears to thousands of mothers' eyes
When their sons go out to fight and lose their lives
I said

[Verse 2]
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker

Induction then destruction
Who wants to die?
Awwww!

Made them disabled, bitter and mean
Life is much too short and precious to be fighting wars these days
War can't give life, it can only take it away, awwww!

[Hook]

Wherever it leads
But remember
If you should fall short of your desires
Remember life holds for you one guarantee
You'll always have me
And if you should miss my lovin'
One of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms
That used to hold you so close
Or the lips that used to touch yours so tenderly
Just remember what I told you
The day I set you free

We're gonna ride
Till there ain't no more to go
Taking it slow
And Lord, don't you know
We'll have me a time with a poor man's lady

Hitchin' on a twilight train

Maybe a song
To sing when I want
No need to say please to no man
For a happy tune

You got the way to make me happy
You and me we go in style
Cracklin' Rose
You're a store-bought woman
But you make me sing like a guitar hummin'
So hang on to me, girl

We got all night to set the world right
Find us a dream that don't ask no questions

To set the world right
Find us a dream that don't ask no questions

[Verse 1: David Cassidy, (Shirley Jones)]
I'm sleeping
And right in the middle of a good dream
Like all at once I wake up
From something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed
Screaming out the words I dread
"I think I love you!"
(I think I love you)

[Verse 2: David Cassidy, (Shirley Jones)]
This morning
I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with
And so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself
And never talk about it
And didn't I go and shout it
When you walked into my room
"I think I love you!"
(I think I love you)
 [Chorus]
I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of?
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
A love there is no cure for

I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of?
Though it worries me to say
That I've never felt this way

[Interlude]
I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I've got so much to think about
Hey!!

[Chorus]
I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of?
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
A love there is no cure for

I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of?
Though it worries me to say
I never felt this way
[Verse 3]
Believe me
You really don't have to worry
I only want to make you happy
And if you say "Hey, go away", I will
But I think better still
I better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case?
Let me ask you to your face

[Outro]
Do you think you love me?
I think I love you!
I think I love you!
I think I love you
I think I love you!
I think I love you!
I think I love you!
I think I love you
I think I love you!
I think I love you

Oh my darling
Knock three times on the ceiling if you want me
Mmm, twice on the pipe if the answer is no

How in my silence I adored you
And only in my dreams did that wall between us
Come apart

I can tell you've been hurt
By that look on your face, girl
Some guy brought sad
Into your happy world

You need love
But you're afraid that if you give in
Someone else will come along
And sock it to you again

Oh, I don't care what they say
I don't care what you heard

If you won't give me a chance to prove my love to you?
Won't you just give me one chance?

 One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch, girl

I'd rather hurt myself
Than to ever hurt you

One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
Oh, give it one more try

232 - Me and Bobby McGee:Janis Joplin
[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
When I was feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
That rode us all the way in to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', don't mean nothin', honey, if it ain't free, no no
Yeah, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
You know feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

[Verse 2]
From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun
Yeah, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
 [Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', and that's all that Bobby left me
Well feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
Hey feelin' good was good enough for me, mhm
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality
She doesn't even know me

Runnin' away with me, oh
Tell you it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time
There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'

Though we really did try to make it
Somethin' inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

It used to be so easy, livin' here with you
You were light and breezy, and I knew just what to do

Though we really did try to make it
Somethin' inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh, no, no
There'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it, too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you
But it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Somethin' inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it

It's too late now, darling

They took the whole Cherokee nation
Put us on this reservation
Took away our ways of life
The tomahawk and the bow and knife
Took away our native tongue
And taught their English to our young
And all the beads we made by hand
Are nowadays made in Japan

Cherokee people, Cherokee tribe
So proud to live, so proud to die

They took the whole Indian nation
Locked us on this reservation
Though I wear a shirt and tie
I'm still part red man deep inside

So proud to live, so proud to die

But maybe someday when they've learned
Cherokee nation will return, will return, will return, will return, will return 1

I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrows

And, how can you mend a broken heart?

How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow

How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
And how can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?

Go away, little girl
Go away, little girl
I'm not supposed to be alone with you
I know that your lips are sweet
But our lips must never meet
I'm dating somebody else
I must be true

Oh, go away little girl
Go away, little girl
It's hurting me more each minute that we delay

When you're near me like this
You're much too hard to resist
So go away, little girl
Before I beg you to stay

Go away, little girl
Go away, little girl
It hurts me more the more that we delay
When you're near me like this
You're much too hard to resist

So go away, little girl

[Verse 1]
Wake up Maggie
I think I got somethin' to say to you
It's late September and I really should be back at school

[Chorus]
I know I keep you amused
But I feel I'm being used
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts

[Verse 2]
The morning sun when it's in your face
Really shows your age
But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything

[Chorus]
I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

[Verse 3]
All I needed was a friend to lend, a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover
And mother what a lover, you wore me out

[Chorus]
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool

[Chorus 4]
Or find myself a rock and roll band
That needs a helpin' hand
Oh Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home, one of these days
Ooh, ooh, ooh

244 - Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves:Cher

I was born in the wagon of a travellin' show
My Mama used to dance for the money they'd throw
Papa would do whatever he could
Preach a little gospel
Sell a couple bottles of Doctor Good

Gypsys, tramps and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsies, tramps and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down

[Verse 2]
Picked up a boy just south of Mobile
Gave him a ride, filled him with a hot meal
I was sixteen, he was twenty-one
Rode with us to Memphis
And Papa would'a shot him if he knew what he'd done

[Chorus]
Gypsys, tramps and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsies, tramps and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down
 [Bridge]
I never had schoolin' but he taught me well
With his smooth southern style
Three months later I'm a gal in trouble
And I haven't seen him for a while, oh
I haven't seen him for a while, oh

[Verse 3]
She was born in the wagon of a travelin' show
Her Mama had to dance for the money they'd throw
Grandpa'd do whatever he could
Preach a little gospel
Sell a couple bottles of Doctor Good

[Chorus]
Gypsys, tramps and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsies, tramps and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down

[Chorus]
Gypsys, tramps and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsies, tramps and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down10

One child grows up to be
Somebody that just loves to learn

247 - Brand New Key:Melanie
[Verse 1]
I rode my bicycle past your window last night
I roller skated to your door at daylight
It almost seems like you're avoiding me
I'm okay alone but you got somethin' I need

[Chorus]
Well, I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key
I think that we should get together
And try them out to see
I've been lookin' around awhile
You got somethin' for me
Oh, I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key

[Verse 2]
I ride my bike, I roller skate, don't drive no car
Don't go too fast but I go pretty far
For somebody who don't drive
I've been all around the world
Some people say I done alright for a girl

[Bridge]
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
 [Verse 3]
I asked your mother if you were at home
She said yes, but you weren't alone
Oh, sometimes I think that you're avoiding me
I'm okay alone but you got somethin' I need

[Chorus]
Well, I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key
I think that we should get together
And try them out to see
La-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la, la
Oh, I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key5

248 - American Pie:Don McLean
[Intro]
A long, long time ago
I can still remember how that music
Used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

[Chorus]
So, bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

[Verse 1]
Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now, do you believe in rock 'n' roll
Can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
 [Chorus]
I started singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

[Verse 2]
Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

[Chorus]
We were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"
[Verse 3]
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now, the halftime air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

[Chorus]
We started singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

[Verse 4]
Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So, come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
[Chorus]
He was singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die..."

[Bridge]
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
[Deleted Verse]
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised Him everything I could give
If only He would make the music live
And He promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

[Chorus]
And they were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

[Outro]
They were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', "This'll be the day that I die"125

Ooh, loving you forever is what I need

Lovin' you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
Ooh, yeah

Turn around and make up, I just can't see
You'd never do that to me, would you baby?

250 - Without You:Nilsson
[Verse 1]
No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

[Verse 2]
No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

[Chorus]
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore

[Verse 1]
Well, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
 [Chorus]
Can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore

[Outro]
If living is without you...5

I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give

252 - A Horse with No Name:America
[Verse 1]
On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

[Chorus]
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

[Verse 2]
After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead
 [Chorus]
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
Because there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

[Chorus]
You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la45

253 - The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face:Roberta Flack
[Verse 1]
The first time, ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars
Were the gifts you gave
To the dark, and the endless skies

[Verse 2]
And the first time, ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hand
Like the trembling heart
Of a captive bird
That was there, at my command
My love

[Verse 3]
And the first time, ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy
Would fill the earth
And last, 'til the end of time
My love

The first time, ever I saw
Your face
Your face
Your face
Your face 2

Oh, girl
I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love
I just don't know how

[Verse 2]
Oh, girl
How I depend on you
To give me love when I need it
Right on time you would always be

[Bridge]
All my friends call me a fool
They say let the woman take care of you
So I try to be hip and think like the crowd
But even the crowd can't help me now, oh

[Verse 3]
Oh, girl
Tell me, what am I gonna do
I know I've got a guilty face
Girl, I feel so out of place, oh, yeah yeah

257 - Song Sung Blue:Neil Diamond
Song sung blue, everybody knows one
Song sung blue, every garden grows one

Me and you are subject to
The blues now and then
But when you take the blues
And make a song
You sing 'em out again

Song sung blue, sleeping on my pillow
Funny thing
But you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know it get to feeling good
You simply got no choice

Me and you are subject to
The blues now and then
But when you take the blues
And make a song
You sing 'em out again

Song sung blue, weeping like a willow
Song sung blue, sleeping on my pillow
Funny thing
But you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know it start to feeling good
You simply got no choice
 Song sung blue

Funny thing
But you can sing it with a cry in your voice

259 - Alone Again (Naturally):Gilbert O'Sullivan
[Verse 1]
Oh, in a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch, at a church
Where people saying
"My God that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home"
As I did on my own

[Refrain]
Alone again, naturally

[Verse 2]
To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, well who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
For if He really does exist
Why did He desert me
In my hour of need?
I truly am indeed
 [Refrain]
Alone again, naturally

[Bridge]
It seems to me that
There are more hearts
Broken in the world
That can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?
What do we do?

[Classical Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
Alone again, naturally

[Verse 3]
Now looking back over the years
And what ever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand, why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
[Refrain]
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally23

260 - Brandy (You're a Fine Girl):Looking Glass
[Verse 1]
There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes

[Verse 2]
And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say "Brandy, fetch another round"
She serves them whiskey and wine

[Chorus 1]
The sailors say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea"

[Verse 3]
Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of a man that Brandy loved

[Verse 4]
He came on a summer's day
Bringing gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home
 [Chorus 2]
The sailor said, "Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea"

[Bridge]
Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes
When he told his sailor's story
She could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its raging glory
But he had always told the truth
Lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand

[Verse 5]
At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say

[Outro]
She hears him say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea
It is, yes, it is"
"Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea
It is, it is, yes, it is"3

I'll never be alone
And you, my friend, will see

Now, it's "us", now, it's "we"

I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben

It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama, I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Mama just hung her head and said, son

Is it true what they say, that papa never worked a day in his life?
And mama, some bad talk goin' round town
Sayin' that papa had three outside children
And another wife, and that ain't right
I heard them talking 'bout papa doing some store front preachin'
Talkin' about saving souls and all the time leechin'
Dealing in dirt, and stealing in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said
 [Chorus]
(Papa was a rolling stone) My son
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)
(And when he died) All he left us was (Alone), hey

I heard papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me, is that what sent papa to an early grave?
Folks say papa would beg, borrow, steal
To pay his bills
Hey, mama
Folks say papa never was much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
Mama looked up with a tear in her eye and said, son

[Verse 1]

In numbers too big to ignore
And I know too much to go back an' pretend
'Cause I've heard it all before
And I've been down there on the floor
No one's ever gonna keep me down again

I am woman

More determined to achieve my final goal

Me and Mrs Jones
We got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong

Holding hands, making all kinds of plans
While the jukebox plays our favorite song

268 - Crocodile Rock:Elton John
[Verse 1]
I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

[Post-Chorus]
Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

[Verse 2]
But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last
 [Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own

We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Singing my life with his words

Telling my whole life with his words

271 - The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia:Vicki Lawrence
He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he'd thought he'd stop at Webb's
And have him a drink before he went home to her

Andy Wolloe said hello
And he said, "Hi, what's doing, Wo?"
Said, "Sit down, I got some bad news, it's gonna hurt."

He said, "I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you been gone, she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth."

Well, he got mad and he saw red
And Andy said, "Boy, don't you lose your head
Cause to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself."

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Well, Andy got scared and left the bar
Walking on home, cause he didn't live far
See, Andy didn't have many friends
And he just lost him one
 Brother thought his wife musta left town
So he went home and finally found
The only thing Papa had left him and that was a gun

Then he went off to Andy's house
Slippin' through the backwoods, quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood and he started to shake

Well, the Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag them down
And a big-bellied sheriff grabbed his gun
And said "Why'd you do it?"
Well, the judge said guilty in a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said, "Supper's waitin' at home and I gotta get to it."

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
And that's one body that'll never be found
See, little sister don't miss when she aims her gun
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia, whoa-oh
That's the night that they hung an innocent man, uh-huh
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods, southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Oh, that's the night that the lights went out in Georgia

277 - Bad, Bad Leroy Brown:Jim Croce
Well the South side of Chicago
Is the baddest part of town
And if you go down there
You better just beware
Of a man named Leroy Brown

Now Leroy more than trouble
You see he stand 'bout six foot four
All the downtown ladies call him "Treetop Lover"
All the men just call him "Sir"

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

Now Leroy he a gambler
And he like his fancy clothes
And he like to wave his diamond rings
In front of everybody's nose

He got a custom Continental
He got an Eldorado too
He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe
 And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

Well Friday bout a week ago
Leroy shootin' dice
And at the edge of the bar
Sat a girl named Doris
And ooh that girl looked nice

Well he cast his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
Leroy Brown he learned a lesson 'bout messin'
With the wife of a jealous man

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

Well the two men took to fightin'
And when they pulled them from the floor
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle
With a couple of pieces gone
And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog2


278 - The Morning After:Maureen McGovern
There's got to be a morning after
If we can hold on through the night
We have a chance to find the sunshine
Let's keep on looking for the light

Oh, can't you see the morning after
It's waiting right outside the storm
Why don't we cross the bridge together
And find a place that's safe and warm

It's not too late
We should be giving
Only with love can we climb
It's not too late
Not while we're living
Let's put our hands out in time

There's got to be a morning after
We're moving closer to the shore
I know we'll be there by tomorrow
And we'll escape the darkness
We won't be searching any more

There's got to be a morning after
(There's got to be a morning after)
There's got to be a morning after
(There's got to be a morning after)
There's got to be a morning after
(There's got to be a morning after)
There's got to be a morning after
(There's got to be a morning after)
There's got to be a morning after

279 - Touch Me in the Morning:Diana Ross
[Intro]
Touch me in the mornin'
Then just walk away
We don't have tomorrow
But we had yesterday

[Verse 1]
Hey, wasn't it me who said
That nothin' good's gonna last forever?
And wasn't it me who said
Let's just be glad for the time together?
It must've been hard to tell me
That you've given all you had to give
I can understand your feelin' that way
Everybody's got their life to live

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I can say goodbye
In the cold mornin' light
But I can't watch love die
In the warmth of the night

[Chorus]
If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to
Have tonight, when you're gone?
'Til you go, I need to
Lie here and think about
The last time that you'll
 [Post-Chorus]
Touch me in the mornin'
Then just close the door
Leave me as you found me
Empty like before

[Verse 2]
Hey, wasn't it yesterday
We used to laugh at the wind behind us?
Didn't we run away and hope
That time wouldn't try to find us?
(Didn't we run?)
Didn't we take each other
To a place where no one's ever been?
Yeah, I really need you near me tonight
'Cause you'll never take me there again

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me watch you go
With the sun in my eyes
We've seen how love can grow
Now we'll see how it dies

[Chorus]
If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to
Have tonight, when you're gone?
'Til you go, I need to
Hold you until the time
Your hands reach out and
[Outro]
Touch me in the mornin'
(In the mornin')
We're blue and gold
And we could feel one another livin'
(Then just walk away)
We walked with a dream to hold
And we could take what the world was givin'
(We don't have tomorrow)
There's no tomorrow here
There's only love and the time to chase it
(But we had yesterday)
Yesterday's gone, my love
There's only now and it's time to face it
(Touch me in the mornin')1

280 - Brother Louie:Stories
She was black as the night;
Louie was whiter than white
Danger, danger when you taste brown sugar
Louie fell in love overnight

Louie had the best girl he could
When he took her home
To meet his mama and papa;
Louie knew just where he stood

Louie Louie Louie louie, Louie Louie Louie Lou I
Louie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie you're gonna cry

There he stood in the night
Knowing what's wrong from what's right
He took her home to meet his mama and papa
Man, they had a terrible fight

Louie nearly caused a scene
Wishin' it was a dream
Ain't no diff'rence if you're black or white
Brothers, you know what I mean, come on
Louie Louie Louie

Louie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie Louie Lou I
Louie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie you're gonna cry
 {Instrumental}

282 - Delta Dawn:Helen Reddy
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say
He was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky

She's forty-one and her daddy still calls 'er "baby"
All the folks 'round Brownsville say she's crazy
'Cause she walks downtown with her suitcase in her hand
Lookin' for a mysterious dark-haired man

In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
Promised her he'd take her for his bride

Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say
He was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky

Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say
He was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
 Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say
He was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky

Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say
He was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky

284 - Half-Breed:Cher
[Verse 1]
My father married a pure Cherokee
My mother's people were ashamed of me
The Indians said I was white by law
The white man always called me "Indian Squaw"

[Chorus]
Half-breed, that's all I ever heard
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word
Half-breed, 'She's no good' they warned
Both sides were against me since the day I was born

[Verse 2]
We never settled, went from town to town
When you're not welcome you don't hang around
The other children always laughed at me
"Give her a feather, she's a Cherokee"

[Chorus]
Half-breed, that's all I ever heard
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word
Half-breed, 'She's no good' they warned
Both sides were against me since the day I was born

[Verse 3]
We weren't accepted and I felt ashamed
Nineteen I left them
Tell me, who's to blame?
My life since then has been from man to man
But I can't run away from what I am
 [Chorus]
Half-breed, that's all I ever heard
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word
Half-breed, 'She's no good' they warned
Both sides were against me since the day I was born
Half-breed, that's all I ever heard
Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word
Half-breed, 'She's no good' they warned
Both sides were against me since the day I was born

When will those clouds all disappear?

With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But Angie, Angie
You can't say we never tried
Angie, you're beautiful, yeah
But ain't it time we said goodbye?
Angie, I still love you
Remember all those nights we cried?
All the dreams we held so close
Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?

[Verse 2]
Oh, Angie, don't you weep
All your kisses still taste sweet
I hate that sadness in your eyes
But Angie, Angie
Ain't it time we said goodbye? Yeah
 [Verse 3]
With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But Angie, I still love you, baby
Everywhere I look, I see your eyes
There ain't a woman that comes close to you
Come on, baby, dry your eyes
But Angie, Angie
Ain't it good to be alive?
Angie, Angie
They can't say we never tried14

Every time I see your face
It reminds me of the places we used to go
But all I've got is a photograph
And I realise you're not coming back any more

But that's not something

There is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream

Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear, it's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world

Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's telling me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me

When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here

Hey
Did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did, was she crying, crying?

Hey
If you happen to see
The most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her

I woke up this morning
Realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
I knew I'd lost my morning sun

I lost my head and I said some things
Now comes the heartaches that morning brings
I know I'm wrong
And I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
If I could save time in a bottle
The first thing that I'd like to do
Is to save every day till eternity passes away
Just to spend them with you

If words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then
Again, I would spend them with you

To do the things you want to do, once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with
[Verse 3]
If I had a box just for wishes
And dreams that had never come true
The box would be empty, except for the memory of how
They were answered by you

To do the things you want to do, once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with

Lips like strawberry wine

You're all ribbons and curls, ooh, what a girl

[Verse 1]

Memories
Light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories
Of the way we were

[Verse 2]
Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were

Can it be that
It was all so simple then?
Or has time re-written every line?
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?
 [Verse 3]
Memories
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget

[Outro]
So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were
Hmmmmm hmmmmm
Hmm hmm hmmmmmm hmmm hmmm hmm hmm
Hmmm hmmm hmmmmm hmmmmm hmmmmmmmmmmm1

296 - Seasons in the Sun:Terry Jacks
[Verse 1]
Goodbye to you, my trusted friend
We've known each other since we were nine or ten
Together we've climbed hills and trees
Learned of love and ABC's
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees
Goodbye my friend, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Pretty girls are everywhere
Think of me and I'll be there

[Chorus 1]
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time

[Verse 2]
Goodbye Papa, please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
You tried to teach me right from wrong
Too much wine and too much song
Wonder how I got along
Goodbye Papa, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Little children everywhere
When you see them, I'll be there
 [Chorus 2]
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons, have all gone
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons, have all gone

[Verse 3]
Goodbye Michelle, my little one
You gave me love and helped me find the sun
And every time that I was down
You would always come around
And get my feet back on the ground
Goodbye Michelle, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
With the flowers everywhere
I wish that we could both be there

[Chorus 3]
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons, have all gone
All our lives, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun9

297 - Dark Lady:Cher
[Verse 1]
The fortune queen of New Orleans
Was brushing her cat in her black limousine
On the back seat were scratches from
The marks of men, her fortune she had won
I couldn't see through the tinted glass;
She said, "Home, James" and he hit the gas
I followed her to some darkened room
She took my money, she said, "I'll be with you soon"

[Chorus]
Dark lady laughed and danced
And lit the candles one by one;
Danced to her gypsy music
'Till her brew was done...
Dark lady played black magic
'Till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me
Than I knew myself...

[Verse 2]
She dealt two cards, a queen and a three
And mumbled some words that were so strange to me
And then she turned up a two-eyed jack
My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black
She said, "The man you love is secretly true
To someone else who is very close to you!
My advice is that you leave this place
Never come back, and forget you ever saw my face!"
 [Chorus]
Dark lady laughed and danced
And lit the candles one by one;
Danced to her gypsy music
Till her brew was done...
Dark lady played black magic
Till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me
Than I knew myself...

[Verse 3]
So I ran home and crawled in my bed
I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said
Then I remembered her strange perfume
And how I smelled it once in my own room
So I snuck back and caught her with my man;
Laughing and kissing til they saw the gun in my hand...
The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor--
Dark Lady would never turn a card up anymore!

[Chorus fades out]
Dark lady laughed and danced
And lit the candles one by one;
Danced to her gypsy music
Til her brew was done...
Dark lady played black magic
Till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me
Than I knew myself...2

[Chorus]
Sunshine
On my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes
Can make me cry
Sunshine on the water
Looks so lovely
Sunshine
Almost always makes me high

[Verse 1]
If I had a day
That I could give you
I'd give to you
The day just like today
If I had a song

On my shoulders makes me happy

On my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes

305 - Billy, Don't Be a Hero:Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods
[Verse 1:]
The marching band came down along Main Street
The soldier blues fell in behind
I looked across and there I saw Billy
Waiting to go and join the line

And with her head upon his shoulder
His young and lovely fiancee
From where I stood I saw she was crying
And through her tears I heard her say

[Chorus:]
Billy, don't be a hero
Don't be a fool with your life
Billy, don't be a hero
Come back and make me your wife

And as he started to go
She said, "Billy, keep your head low."
Billy, don't be hero
Come back to me

[Verse 2:]
The soldier blues were trapped on a hillside
The battle raging all around
The sergeant cried, "We've got to hang on, boys!
We've got to hold this piece of ground."
 I need a volunteer to ride up
And bring us back some extra men."
And Billy's hand was up in a moment
Forgetting all the words she said

That told how Billy died that day
The letter said that he was a hero
She should be proud
He died that way
I heard she threw the letter away

Sundown, you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs

And she don't always say what she really means

When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain

I can picture every move that a man could make
Getting lost in her lovin' is your first mistake

I can see her lookin' fast in her faded jeans
She's a hard lovin' woman, got me feelin' mean

Sundown, you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs

310 - The Night Chicago Died:Paper Lace
[Intro]
Daddy was a cop on the east side of Chicago
Back in the U.S.A., back in the bad old days

[Verse 1]
In the heat of a summer night
In the land of the dollar bill
When the town of Chicago died
And they talk about it still

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When a man named Al Capone
Tried to make that town his own
And he called his gang to war
With the forces of the law

[Chorus]
I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night it really was
Brother what a fight it really was
Glory be!
I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night the people saw
Brother what a fight the people saw
Yes indeed!
 [Verse 2]
And the sound of the battle rang
Through the streets of the old east side
'Til the last of the hoodlum gang
Had surrendered up or died

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There was shouting in the street
And the sound of running feet
And I asked someone who said
''Bout a hundred cops are dead!"

[Chorus]
I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night it really was
Brother what a fight it really was
Glory be!
I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night the people saw
Brother what a fight the people saw
Yes indeed!

[Verse 3]
Then there was no sound at all
But the clock upon the wall
Then the door burst open wide
And my daddy stepped inside
And he kissed my mama's face
And he brushed her tears away
[Chorus]
The night Chicago died
(Na-na na, na-na-na, na-na-na)
The night Chicago died
Brother what a night the people saw
Brother what a fight the people saw
Yes indeed!

[Outro]
The night Chicago died
(Na-na na, na-na-na, na-na-na)
The night Chicago died
Brother what a night it really was
Brother what a fight it really was
Glory be!

312 - I Shot the Sheriff:Eric Clapton
[Chorus 1]
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy

[Verse 1]
All around in my home town
They're trying to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy
But I say

[Chorus 2]
I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff, and they say it is a capital offense

[Verse 2]
Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what I don't know
Every time that I plant a seed
He said, "Kill it before it grows"
He said, "Kill it before it grows"
I say

[Chorus 2]
 [Verse 3]
Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town
All of a sudden I see sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I shot, I shot him down
I say

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 4]
Reflexes got the better of me
And what is to be must be
Every day the bucket goes to the well
But one day the bottom will drop out
Yes, one day the bottom will drop out
But I say

[Chorus 1]4

But I got something to tell you
That I never thought I would
But I believe you really ought to know

[Chorus]
I love you
I honestly love you

That it's coming from my heart and not my head

I love you
I honestly love you

If we both were born
In another place and time

I honestly love you
I honestly love you

By all the things you say that you'll do
Though much concerned but not involved
With decisions that are made by you

'Cause if you really want to hear our views

The world is tired of pacifiers

[Intro]
Oh-ho-ho-ho
Oh-ho-ho-ho
Oh-ho-ho-ho
Oh-ho-ho-ho

[Chorus]
Everybody was kung fu fighting
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

[Verse 1]
There were funky China men from funky Chinatown
They were chopping them up, they were chopping them down
It's an ancient Chinese art and everybody knew their part
From a feint into a slip and a kicking from the hip

[Chorus]
Everybody was kung fu fighting, huh
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening, hey, yeah
But they fought with expert timing

[Verse 2]
There was funky Billy Chin and little Sammy Chung
He said, "Here comes the big boss, let's get it on"
We took a bow and made a stand, started swaying with the hand
A sudden motion made me skip, now we're into a brand new trip

Everybody was kung fu fighting (Huh!)
Those cats were fast as lightning (Ha!)
In fact, it was a little bit frightening (Huh!)
But they did it with expert timing (Ha!)

323 - Cat's in the Cradle:Harry Chapin
[Verse 1]
My child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say, "I'm gonna be like you, Dad
You know I'm gonna be like you"

[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home, Dad?"
"I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then"

[Verse 2]
My son turned ten just the other day
He said, "Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw?" I said, "Not today
I got a lot to do." He said, "That's okay"
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
It said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him"

[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home, Dad?"
"I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then"
 [Verse 3]
Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
"Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?"
He shook his head and he said with a smile
"What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later, can I have them please?"

[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home, son?"
"I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad
You know we'll have a good time then"

[Verse 4]
I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, "I'd like to see you if you don't mind"
He said, "I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad
It's been sure nice talking to you"
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me
[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home, son?"
"I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad
We're gonna have a good time then"17

324 - Angie Baby:Helen Reddy
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
You live your life in the songs you hear
On the rock 'n' roll radio
And when a young girl doesn't have any friends
That's a really nice place to go
Folks hoping you'd turn out cool
But they had to take you outta school
You're a little touched, you know, Angie, baby

[Verse 2]
Lovers appear in your room each night
And they whirl you 'cross the floor (Angie)
But they always seem to fade away
When your daddy taps on your door
"Angie girl, are you all right?
Tell the radio goodnight"
All alone once more, Angie, baby

[Chorus]
Angie, baby, you're a special lady
Living in a world of make-believe
Well, maybe

[Verse 3]
Stopping at her house is a neighbor boy
With evil on his mind
'Cause he's been peekin' in Angie's room
At night through her window blind
"I see your folks have gone away
Would you dance with me today?
I'll show you how to have a good time, Angie, baby"
(Angie, baby, Angie, baby)
 [Verse 4]
When he walks in her room
He feels confused like he walked into a play
And the music's so loud, it spins him around
'Til his soul has lost its way
And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
Toward the radio he's bound, never to be found

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
'Cept a crazy girl with a secret lover
Who keeps her satisfied
It's so nice to be insane
No one asks you to explain
Radio by your side, Angie, baby

[Chorus]
Angie, baby, you're a special lady
Living in a world of make-believe
Well, maybe
[Outro]
Well, maybe (Angie, baby, Angie, baby)
Well, maybe (Angie, baby, Angie, baby)
(Angie, baby, Angie, baby)
(Angie, baby, Angie, baby)...3

325 - Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds:Elton John
[Verse 1]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ohh

[Verse 2]
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

[Pre-Chorus]
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone
 [Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ohh

[Pre-Chorus]
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waitin' to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ohh

[Verse 3]
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ohh
[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Ohh

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)

326 - Mandy:Barry Manilow
[Verse 1]
I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into

[Verse 2]
Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me

[Chorus]
Oh, Mandy
Well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you today
Oh, Mandy
 [Verse 3]
I'm standing on the edge of time
I've walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world
Of uphill climbing
The tears are in my eyes
And nothing is rhyming

[Chorus]
Oh, Mandy
Well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy

Without an umbrella, we're soaked to the skin
I feel a shiver run up my spine

Oh, how I love the rainy days
And the happy way I feel inside

I turn to her and she kisses me
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves (there with the beat)
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes

332 - Best of My Love:Eagles
[Verse 1]
Every night I'm lying in bed
Holding you close in my dreams
Thinking about all the things that we said
And coming apart at the seams
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough

[Refrain]
I know you were trying
To give me the best of your love

[Verse 2]
Beautiful faces
And loud, empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give
That same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above

[Refrain]
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love

 [Bridge]
I'm going back in time
And it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping

[Verse 3]
But every morning
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way
And I see it mine
But we both see it slippin' away
You know we always had each other baby
I guess that wasn't enough

[Refrain]
Oh-uh-oh, but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

[Chorus/Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling
You get the best of my love

[Intro]

[Chorus]
My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me, you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far

[Verse 1]
Carried your books from school
Playing make-believe you're married to me
You were fifth grade, I was sixth
When we came to be

[Verse 2]
Walking home every day, over
Barnegat Bridge and Bay
'Til we grew into the me and you
Who went our separate ways

[Chorus]
My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far
 [Verse 3]
Headed for city lights
Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to the bone
Made myself a name

[Verse 4]
Funny, I seem to find
That no matter how the years unwind
Still I reminisce 'bout the girl I miss
And the love I left behind

[Chorus]
My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far

All my life I will remember
How warm and tender we were way back then
Though I'm feeling sad regrets
I know I won't ever forget you, my childhood friend
[Instrumental]

[Outro]
(My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you

And yet so far
My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away...)2

Well, life on a farm is kinda laid back
Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack
It's early to rise, early in the sack

A-raisin' me a family and working on the farm
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God I'm a country boy

When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

When the work's all done and the sun's setting low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low

But the Lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
So I fiddle when I can and I work when I should
Thank God I'm a country boy

[Verse 4]
Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
And he took me by the hand, held me close to his side
Said, "Live a good life, play my fiddle with pride
Thank God you're a country boy."
My daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
He taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
He taught me how to love and how to give just a little
And thank God I'm a country boy
[Chorus]
Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle
Whoo, thank God I'm a country boy, yes!3

351 - Rhinestone Cowboy:Glen Campbell
[Verse 1]
I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

[Chorus]
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

[Verse 2]
Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
 [Chorus]
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

[Bridge]
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

[Fade]
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' card and letters from people I don't even know5

To bind your time, it drives you to crime

353 - I'm Sorry:John Denver
[Verse 1]
It's cold here in the city
It always seems that way
And I've been thinking about you
Almost everyday
Thinking about the good times
Thinking about the rain
Thinking about how bad it feels
Alone again

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for the way things are in China
I'm sorry things ain't what they used to be
But more than anything else, I'm sorry for myself
'Cause you're not here with me

[Verse 2]
Our friends all ask about you, I say you're doing fine
And I expect to hear from you almost anytime
But they all know I'm crying and I can't sleep at night
They all know I'm dying down deep inside

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for all the lies I've told you
I'm sorry for the things I didn't say
But more than anything else
I'm sorry for myself
I can't believe you went away
 [Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm sorry
If I took some things for granted
I'm sorry
For the chains I put on you
But more than anything else
I'm sorry for myself
For living without you
It's cold here in the city
It always seems that way
And I've been thinking about you almost every day3

354 - Bad Blood:Neil Sedaka
It could've been me
But it was you
Who went and bit off
A little bit more
Than he could chew

You said that you had it made
But you been had
The woman no good
No how
Thinking maybe the blood is bad

Bad (bad) blood (blood)
The woman was born to lie
Makes promises she can't keep
With the wink of an eye

Bad (bad) blood (blood)
Brother, you've been deceived
It's bound to change your mind
About all you believe

From where I stand
It looks mighty strange
How you let a woman like that
Treat you like small change
 I don't understand
What you're lookin' to find
The only thing bad blood do
Is mess up a good man's mind
Hear me talkin' now

Bad (bad) blood (blood)
The bitch is in her smile
The lie is on her lips
Such an evil child

Bad (bad) blood (blood)

The only thing good about bad blood
Is lettin' it slide

The lie is on her lips
Such an evil child

Is takin' you for a ride
The only thing good about bad blood
Is lettin' it slide

The only thing good about bad blood
Is letting it slide1

[Verse 1]
I've been alive forever
And I wrote the very first song
I put the words and the melodies together
I am music and I write the songs

[Chorus]
I write the songs that make the whole world sing
I write the songs of love and special things
I write the songs that make the young girls cry
I write the songs, I write the songs

[Verse 2]
My home lies deep within you
And I've got my own place in your soul
Now when I look out through your eyes
I'm young again, even though I'm very old

[Chorus]
I write the songs that make the whole world sing
I write the songs of love and special things
I write the songs that make the young girls cry
I write the songs, I write the songs

[Bridge]
Oh, my music makes you dance
And gives your spirit to take a chance
And I wrote some rock 'n' roll so you can move
Music fills your heart, well, that's a real fine place to start
It's from me, it's for you
It's from you, it's from me
It's a worldwide symphony
 [Chorus]
I write the songs that make the whole world sing
I write the songs of love and special things
I write the songs that make the young girls cry

361 - Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To):Diana Ross
[Hook]
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?

[Verse 1]
Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds
You knew I loved you, but my spirit was free
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me

[Hook]
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?

[Verse 2]
Now, looking back at all we've passed
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be?
 [Hook]
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?3

363 - 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover:Paul Simon
[Verse 1]
"The problem is all inside your head," she said to me
"The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover"
She said, "It's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude"
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

[Chorus]
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
Ooh, slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
 [Verse 2]
She said, "It grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again"
I said "I appreciate that, and would you please explain
About the 50 ways?"
She said, "Why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning, you'll begin to see the light"
And then she kissed me, and I realized she probably was right
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

[Chorus]
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
Slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free9

Well, losing every step of the way (Hey, what'd you do?)
I said, "I must go back there", I got to go back
And check to see if things still the same

Hey, wait a minute, now first it wasn't easy
Changing rock and roll and minds
Yeah, things were getting shaky
(Yeah) I thought I'd have to leave it behind, uh
Ooh, but now it's so much better, it's so much better
I'm funking out in every way
But I'll never lose that feeling, no, I won't
Of how I learned my lesson that day

[Pre-Chorus]
When they were dancing and singing
And moving to the grooving
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

[Chorus]
"Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die", heh heh
'Til you die (Yeah)
Oh, 'til you die, yeah
Come on, let's go!

[Outro]
(They shouted, "Play that funky music") Play that funky music
(Play that funky music) You gotta keep on playing funky music
(Play that funky music) Play that funky music
(Play that funky music) Come on and take you higher
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right, yeah
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right, yeah
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right, yeah
Play that funky music, honky
Play that funky music right4

383 - I Wish:Stevie Wonder
[Verse 1]
Looking back on when I was a little nappy-headed boy
Then my only worry was for Christmas, what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, "Boy, thought I told you not to go outside"
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whoopin' your behind

[Chorus]
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
'Cause I love them so

[Verse 2]
Brother said he's telling 'bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell and I'll give you anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (You nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing ain't right
But while you were doing it, it sure felt outta sight
 [Chorus]
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?6

385 - Torn Between Two Lovers:Mary MacGregor
[Verse 1]
There are times when a woman has to say what's on her mind
Even though she knows how much it's gonna hurt
Before I say another word let me tell you, I love you
Let me hold you close and say these words as gently as I can

[Verse 2]
There's been another man that I've needed and I've loved
But that doesn't mean I love you less
And he knows he can't possess me and he knows he never will
There's just this empty place inside of me that only he can fill

Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

You mustn't think you've failed me
Just because there's someone else
You were the first real love I ever had
And all the things I ever said, I swear they still are true
For no one else can have the part of me I gave to you

[Chorus]
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules
 [Bridge]
I couldn't really blame you if you turned and walked away
But with everything I feel inside, I'm asking you to stay

Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool

Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

[Verse 1]
Madman, drummers, bummers
Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older
I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasin', sneezin' and wheezin'
The calliope crashed to the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
The calliope crashed to the ground!

But, she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

Blinded by the light

 [Verse 2]
Some silicone sister with a manager mister
Told me I got what it takes
She said, "I'll turn you on, son, into something strong
Play the song with the funky break"
And go-kart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe outside
And little Early-Pearly came by in his curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride

[Pre-Chorus]
Asked me if I needed a ride!

[Chorus]
But, she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

She's gonna make it through the night

But mama, that's where the fun is
Mama always told me not to look into the eyes of the sun
But mama, that's where the fun is
[Piano Solo]

[Verse 3]
Some brimstone, baritone, anticyclone, rolling stone
Preacher from the east
Says, "Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in it's funny bone that's where they expect it least"
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone reminding him of romance
[Pre-Chorus]
The calliope crashed to the ground!

[Chorus]
But she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

(Now, Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(And throws his lover in the sand)
Blinded by the light
(Some bloodshot forget-me-not said daddy's within earshot)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(Save the buckshot, turn up the band)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

Great expectations, everybody's watching you
People you meet, they all seem to know you
Even your old friends treat you like you're something new

[Chorus]
Johnny-come-lately, the new kid in town
Everybody loves you, so don't let them down

Tears on your shoulder

388 - Love Theme From A Star Is Born (Evergreen):Barbra Streisand
Love soft as an easy chair
Love fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you

Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two

You and I will make each night a first
Everyday a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and excite us
'Cause we have the brightest love

Two lights that shine as one
Morning glory and midnight sun
Time we've learned to sail above
Time won't change the meaning of one love
Ageless and ever evergreen 

389 - Dancing Queen:ABBA
[Chorus]
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Verse 1]
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Chorus]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen
 [Verse 2]
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Chorus]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Outro]
Digging the dancing queen47

390 - Southern Nights:Glen Campbell
[Verse 1]
Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night?
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistlin' tunes that you know and love so

[Verse 2]
Southern nights
Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize
To anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

[Verse 3]
Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies? (In Southern sky)
Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes runnin' through your soul
Like the stories told of old

[Verse 4]
Old man
He and his dog, they walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin' willows would cry for joy, joy
 [Verse 5]
Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da

[Verse 6]
Mystery
Like this and many others in the trees
Blow in the night
In the Southern skies

Southern nights
They feel so good, it's a frightening
Wish I could (Southern nights)
Stop this world from the fighting

391 - When I Need You:Leo Sayer
[Hook]
When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you
It's only a heartbeat away

When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day


[Verse 1]
Miles and miles of empty space in between us
A telephone can't take the place of your smile
But you know I won't be traveling forever
It's cold out, but hold out and do like I do


[Hook]
When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you, babe
It's only a heartbeat away

Honey, that's a heavy load that we bear
But you know I won't be traveling a lifetime
It's cold out, but hold out and do like I do

Oh, I need you

When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day

Keeping me warm night and day

All I want to give you
Is only a heartbeat away
Oh I need you darling
Oh i want you darling

392 - Sir Duke:Stevie Wonder
[Verse 1]
Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance, and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

[Chorus]
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people, go

[Verse 2]
Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers

399 - Looks Like We Made It:Barry Manilow
[Verse 1]
There you are
Looking just the same as you did last time I touched you
And here I am
Close to getting tangled up inside the thought of you

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you love him
As much as I love her?
And will that love be strong
When old feelings start to stir?

[Chorus]
Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so till today
Until you were there, everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it

[Verse 2]
Love's so strange
Playing hide and seek with hearts and always hurting
And we're the fools
Standing close enough to touch those burning memories
 [Pre-Chorus]
And if I hold you
For the sake of all those times
Love made us lose our minds
Could I ever let you go?

[Chorus]
Whoa no, we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so till today
Until you were there, everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it
Oh, we made it

Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way to another love

Whoa babe, we made it
Looks like we made it

402 - Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band:Meco
GUY RAZ, BYLINE: The TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And today on the show, what's original? Is there anything that can, like, we could really say is totally original?

KIRBY FERGUSON: The Big Bang. As far as we know the Big Bang is original.

RAZ: And everything else after that...

FERGUSON: Everything else yeah.

RAZ: ...You know, derivative.

FERGUSON: Yes.

RAZ: This is Kirby Ferguson, he's a filmmaker and made a series of films called "Everything Is A Remix" because, as Kirby explains in those films, every painting, every song, every idea comes from somewhere else. And the basic element of creativity comes from remixing.

FERGUSON: All of our works emerge out of our influences, out of building, you know, upon the works and with the works of other people.

RAZ: Like, for example, Bob Dylan.

RAZ: Here's Kirby from the TED stage.

(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)

FERGUSON: All right, let's head back to 1964, and let's hear where some of Dylan's early songs came from. We'll do some side-by-side comparisons here.

All right, this first song you're going to hear is "Nottamun Town." It's your traditional folk tune. After that, you'll hear Dylan's "Masters of War."
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "Nottamun Town")

JEAN RITCHIE: (Singing) In Nottamun Town, not a soul would look out, not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MASTERS OF WAR")

BOB DYLAN: (Singing) Come you masters of war and build the big guns. You that build the death planes. You that build all the bombs.

FERGUSON: So that's the same basic melody and overall structure. This next one is "The Patriot Game," by Dominic Behan. Alongside that, you're going to hear "With God on Our Side," by Dylan.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE PATRIOT GAME")

DOMINIC BEHAN: (Singing) Come all ye young rebels, and list' while I sing,

for the love of one's land is a terrible thing.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "WITH GOD ON OUR SIDE")

DYLAN: (Singing) Oh, my name, it is nothin', my age, it means less, the country I come from is called the Midwest.

FERGUSON: Now, there's a lot of these. It's been estimated that two-thirds of melodies Dylan used in his early songs were borrowed.

RAZ: So I'm hearing all of these Bob Dylan things, right? And, like, it's hard for me to say because we're talking about Bob Dylan. But he stole all of this stuff. If this happened today with Twitter, like within seconds of the release of his record he would be hammered.

FERGUSON: He would be, yeah. I mean, it was a different era, he was a folk musician and the idea back then was not that you came up with original songs. The idea was you took the songs that came before you and you did new things with them, you know. You would write new lyrics to existing melody or vice versa. You contributed to this body of folk music. That was the idea back then. So he wasn't unusual in what he was doing. He was doing what they do in folk music.
RAZ: And this happens all the time in all kinds of music. So take Led Zeppelin for example, who used to listen to another band called Spirit.

FERGUSON: And Spirit were, you know, they haven't really stood the test of time, but they were a reasonably well-known band in the '60s and Zeppelin toured with them.

RAZ: Which could be why this song is not "Stairway To Heaven." It's called "Taurus." And it came out two years earlier. They basically ripped off "Taurus."

FERGUSON: Yeah, they sound a lot a like. And it does sound like the opening of "Stairway To Heaven" is fairly difficult to distinguish from that segment of "Taurus."

RAZ: Kirby, there has to be an original idea out there in the world.

FERGUSON: I don't really think so. Again, you can merge things together and you can do that so much that it can be difficult to tell where something came from, you know. You can be layering and layering and layering until the end result is really unrecognizable. But I think human beings aren't really capable of coming up with something from nowhere. Like, I think we just do not do that. We build out of materials. We use tools to make things. That's what we do. I don't think we summon things out of the blue.

RAZ: And even when we think of something as totally new, totally different, like, Star Wars.

FERGUSON: George Lucas was a famous fan of Akira Kurosawa.

RAZ: He was the Japanese director who made all those samurai films in the '50s and '60s.

FERGUSON: Just the styling of the Jedi Knights is very samurai and the look of Darth Vader, like the look of his helmet looks a lot like the armor of samurai warriors. And, you know, the famous Cantina scene in the first Star Wars.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE")

ALFIE CURTIS: (As Dr. Evazan) I don't like you either. You just watch yourself. We're wanted men.

FERGUSON: There's a bragging bad guy who ends up getting his arm chopped off. That resembles a scene from, I believe, it's "Yojimbo."
RAZ: But here's the thing, nobody thinks of Star Wars as derivative, even though it clearly draws upon Kurosawa's work. So where's the line between copying and building on something that came before?

FERGUSON: I mean, to me it's about how much you - how much mimicry you do, how much of the other artist you are taking. So if you take a large chunk of it, to me that is where you're being derivative, you're being unoriginal. You know, I think you need to be transforming the things that you copy. You need to be recontextualizing them. It's about where are you taking your copying to. And you need to be, you know, transforming and combining those elements in exciting ways.

(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)

FERGUSON: Now, American copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others. Instead, these laws, and laws around the world, use the rather awkward analogy of property. Now, creative works may indeed be kind of like property, but it's property that we're all building on, and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared.

RAZ: So it's 2007.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEVE JOBS: A widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough Internet communications device.

RAZ: Steve Jobs on stage at MacWorld, and he introduces the iPhone.

JOBS: These are not three separate devices. This is one device.

RAZ: It's a complete breakthrough.

JOBS: And we have invented a new technology called multitouch - you can do multi-finger gestures on it, and, boy, have we patented it.

RAZ: OK, so that was in 2007. But a year earlier in 2006, an interface designer named Jeff Han gave a TED talk describing the very same technology. And Kirby Ferguson actually showed that footage of Jeff Han in his TED talk.

(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)

FERGUSON: Let's hear what Jeff Han has to say about this newfangled technology.

JEFF HAN: Multitouch sensing isn't anything - isn't completely new. I mean, people like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '80s. The technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility.

FERGUSON: So he's pretty frank about it not being new. So it's not multi-touch as a whole that's patented, it's the small parts of it that are. And it's in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent - to promote the progress of useful arts. Now, this idea that everything is a remix might sound like common sense until you're the one getting remixed.

RAZ: So remember that Picasso quote that Mark Ronson mentioned a bit earlier? Well, listen to Steve jobs in 1996.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOBS: I mean, Picasso had a saying. He said, good artists copy, great artists steal. And we have, you know, always been shameless about stealing great ideas.

RAZ: OK, so fast-forward 14 years later, 2010, when Google's android phone started to challenge Apple's iPhone. Steve Jobs was quoted saying this.

JOBS: I'm going to destroy android because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go thermal nuclear war on this. Ok, so in other words, great artists steal, but not from me.

RAZ: Yeah, I mean, you think about Steve Jobs, right? The idea that he had one point in his career, you know, that admits to sort of stealing great ideas and then later on in his career saying, I will crush those people who steal my ideas, is crazy. I mean, the iPhone, which is an amazingly beautiful piece of technology, is all the result of the work of the people - touchscreen technology, cell phones and GPS and the Internet. Like, without any of those things, that wouldn't exist.

FERGUSON: Yeah, absolutely.

RAZ: So why wouldn't he acknowledge that?

FERGUSON: I think it's a very individualistic fantasy. It makes good stories, talking about individuals, talking about Steve Jobs or Picasso or whoever. It's good stories. And I think that's what we are geared towards. We're geared towards stories that are about individuals because that's how we navigate this world, so we respond to stories that way, whereas telling stories about society, about this incredibly complex mass of human activity, that is a much harder story to tell.

RAZ: So how do we start to think about all this in a completely different way?

FERGUSON: I think it is important to say what you took and from where. I think transparency about what you're doing is a big deal nowadays. And I think most people just want other people to know that, hey, like, that's my bit, you know, that little piece of that thing, that's mine, I did that. And I think just, you know, being more reflective, you know, when you're on the receiving end of getting copied, just think for a moment about where that came from. You know, is it really yours because we definitely fool ourselves about where our ideas come from.

RAZ: Kirby Ferguson, he's a filmmaker. His movie on originality is called, "Everything Is A Remix." Check out his whole talk at ted.npr.org.

AXIS OF AWESOME: (Singing) Time to say goodbye. Should old acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind. I'm more than a bird, I'm more than a plane, I'm a bird-plane.

403 - You Light Up My Life:Debby Boone
[Verse 1]
So many nights
I'd sit by my window
Waiting for someone
To sing me his song

So many dreams
I've kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark
But now you've come along

[Chorus]
And you
Light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights
With song

[Verse 2]
Rolling at sea
Adrift on the water
Could it be finally

Finally, a chance
To say, "Hey, I love you,"
Never again
To be all alone

When it feels so right

You light up my life

404 - How Deep Is Your Love:Bee Gees
[Verse 1]
I know your eyes in the mornin' sun
I feel you touch me in the pourin' rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

[Pre-Chorus]
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my saviour when I fall

When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

405 - Baby Come Back:Player
[Verse 1]
Spending all my nights, all my money going out on the town
Doing anything just to get you off of my mind
But when the morning comes, I'm right back where I started again
And tryin' to forget you is just a waste of time

[Chorus]
Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you

All day long, I'm wearing a mask of false bravado
Trying to keep up a smile that hides a tear
But as the sun goes down, I get that empty feeling again
How I wish to God that you were here

Baby come back, oh baby, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you, oh

Give me the chance to make you see
Have you used up all the love in your heart?
Nothing left for me? Ain't there nothing left for me?

Baby come back, oh darling, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, listen baby, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you
I was wrong and I just can't live10

407 - (Love Is) Thicker Than Water:Andy Gibb
[Chorus:]
Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamer's only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter

[Verse 1:]
Say, my mind
Should I go with her on silent nights
She'll drive me crazy in the end
And I should leave this paradise

But I can't leave her
While I need her more
Than she needs you
That's what I'm living for

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Say, my thought
Should I find out she don't care at all
She'll leave me crying in the end
Wandering through the afterglow

But I can't leave her
While I need her more
Than she needs you
That's what I'm praying for
 [Repeat Chorus x2:]

La, la, la
La, la, la, la, la...

When there's got to be no chance for me
My life would end

My tears of love are a waste of time
If I turn away

Am I strong enough to see it through?
Go crazy is what I will do

I was chasing your direction, I was telling you no lies
And I was loving you
When the words are said, baby, I lose my head

[Pre-Chorus]

There ain't nothing come between us in the end
How can I hold you when you ain't even mine?
Only you can see me through

Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right, uh-huh
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more

I was chasing your affection, I was doing you no harm
And I was loving you
Make it shine, make it rain, baby I know my way

I can't breathe when you're away, it pulls me down

Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say
"Hey, what's the matter, man?

Asking people, "What's the matter with you, boy?"
Sometimes, I want to say to, to myself
Sometimes I say

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, I won't miss you child

[Verse 4]

It's just you and no one else

We got a lovin' thing, we gotta feed it right
There ain't no danger, we can go too far
We start believin' now that we can be who we are

We stop the fight right now, we got to be what we feel

418 - You Needed Me:Anne Murray
[Verse 1]
I cried a tear
You wiped it dry
I was confused
You cleared my mind
I sold my soul
You bought it back for me
And held me up
And gave me dignity
Somehow, you needed me

[Chorus]
You gave me strength
To stand alone again
To face the world
Out on my own again
You put me high
Upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me
You needed me

[Bridge]
And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true!
I needed you
And you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave? I'd be a fool
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares
 [Verse 2]
You held my hand
When it was cold
When I was lost
You took me home
You gave me hope
When I was at the end
And turned my lies
Back into truth again
You even called me friend

You gave me strength
To stand alone again
To face the world
Out on my own again
You put me high
Upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me
You needed me

419 - MacArthur Park:Donna Summer
[Verse 1]
Spring was never waiting for us, dear
It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
Between the parted pages, we were pressed
In love's hot fevered iron
Like a striped pair of pants

[Chorus]
MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again, again

[Verse 2]
I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground beneath your knees
The birds like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing
Chinese checkers by the trees

[Chorus]
MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again, again
 [Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
There will be another song for me
And I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it

[Verse 3]
I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sun, yeah
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life, you'll still be the one

[Verse 4]
I will take my life into my hands and I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it

420 - You Don't Bring Me Flowers:Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond
[Verse 1: Barbra Streisand & Neil Diamond]
You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When you come through the door
At the end of the day

[Chorus: Barbra Streisand & Neil Diamond]
I remember when
You couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after lovin' me late at night
When it's good for you, babe
And you're feeling alright
Well, you just roll over
And you turn out the light
And you don't bring me flowers anymore

[Verse 2: Neil Diamond & Barbra Streisand]
It used to be so natural (Used to be)
To talk about forever (Mmm)
But 'used to be's' don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor
'Til we sweep them away
And baby, I remember
All the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh
And I learned how to cry
Well, I learned how to love
And learned how to lie
 [Chorus: Neil Diamond & Barbra Streisand]
So you'd think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye
(So you'd think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye)
You don't bring me flowers anymore

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Neil Diamond & Barbra Streisand, Neil Diamond]

How to tell you goodbye

Sugar, sugar
Ooh

She sits alone waitin' for suggestions
He's so nervous, avoidin' all the questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently poundin'
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinkin'?

At last, he can tell exactly what his heart meant

They wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singing
Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking

Never mind, sugar, we can watch the early movie"

Going home, I just can't make it all alone
I really should be holding you, holding you
Loving you, loving you

[Chorus]

When the feeling's gone, and you can't go on, It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're going nowhere

425 - What a Fool Believes:The Doobie Brothers
[Verse 1]
He came from somewhere back in her long ago
The sentimental fool don't see
Tryin' hard to recreate
What had yet to be created once in her life
She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize it never really was

[Pre-Chorus]
She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

[Chorus]
But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
Than nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere
She will return
 [Pre-Chorus]
She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

[Chorus]
But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
(If love can come and love can go, then why can't love return once more?)
Is always better than nothing
(Who got the power?)
Than nothing at all (Oh, now)

What a fool believes
(I believe she's never gone away) he sees
No wise man has the power (To reason away)
To reason away
What seems to be
(Oh, if love can come and love can go, oh, mama)
Is always better than nothing (Better than nothing)
Than nothing at all (Oh, I believe)24

430 - Love You Inside Out:Bee Gees
[Verse 1]
Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies don't gimme no rise
Oh, oh what you're trying to do?

Livin' on your cheatin'
And the pain grows inside me
It's enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever but you're
Driving me insane
And I'm hanging on
Oh, oh, I'll win, I'll never give in

Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
Ain't good for you
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right

I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
 What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in one
Lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm

Let this moment be forever
We won't ever feel the storm
I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out

I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Don't try to tell me it's all over
I can't hear a word I can't hear a line
No man could love you more
And that's what I'm cryin' for
You can't change the way I feel inside

You're the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand
Between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me
I will love you till I die
[Outro]
I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?1

Our new state of mind
These are the good times

[Verse 1]
Happy days are here again
The time is right for makin' friends
Let's get together, how 'bout a quarter to ten?
Come tomorrow, let's all do it again
Boys will be boys, better let them have their toys
Girls will be girls, cute ponytails and curls
Must put an end to this stress and strife
I think I want to live the sporting life

[Chorus]
Good times
These are the good times
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times
Good times
These are the good times
Our new state of mind
These are the good times
 [Verse 2]
A rumor has it that it's getting late
Time marches on, just can't wait
The clock keeps turning, why hesitate?
You silly fool; you can't change your fate
Let's cut the rug, a little jive and jitterbug
We want the best, we won't settle for less
Don't be a drag; participate
Clams on the half shell, and roller skates, roller skates

[Hook]
Good times

434 - Sad Eyes:Robert John
[Verse 1]
Looks like it's over
You knew I couldn't stay
She's coming home today
We had a good thing
I'll miss your sweet love
Why must you look at me that way
It's over

Sad eyes, turn the other way
I don't want to see you cry
Sad eyes, you knew there'd come a day
When we would have to say goodbye

The magic that we shared
In time your broken heart will mend
I never used you
You knew I really cared
I hate to see it
Have to end
But it's over

I don't want to see you cry
Sad eyes, you knew there'd come a day

Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
Make it come out right

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know

Some folks can't hold out that long
But nobody wants to go home now
There's too much goin' on

Last all, last all summer long
Some time before the sun comes up
The radio is gonna play that song

438 - Still:Commodores
[Verse 1]
Lady, morning's just a moment away
And I'm without you once again
You laughed at me
You said you never needed me
I wonder if you need me now

[Chorus]
We played the games that people play
We made mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart
You needed me
Remembering the pain if I must say
It's deep in my mind and locked away
But then most of all
I do love you
Still

[Verse 2]
Those memories
Times I'm sure we'll never forget
Those feelings we can't put aside
For what we had
Sometimes I try to understand
But it's so heavy on my mind
So many dreams that flow away
So many words we didn't say
Two people lost in a storm
Where did we go?
Where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found
You know we let each other down
But then most of all
I do love You
Still
 [Chorus]
We played the games that people play
We made our mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart
You needed me
'Cause I needed you so desperately!
We were too blind to see
But then most of all
I do love You
Still

Babe, I'm leaving
I must be on my way
The time is drawing near
My train is going
I see it in your eyes
The love, the need, your tears

But I'll be lonely without you
And I'll need your love to see me through
So please believe me
My heart is in your hands
And I'll be missing you

[Chorus]
'Cause you know it's you, Babe
Whenever I get weary
And I've had enough
Feel like giving up
You know it's you, Babe
Giving me the courage
And the strength I need
Please believe that it's true
Babe, I love you
 [Chorus]
You know it's you, Babe
Whenever I get weary
And I've had enough
Feel like giving up
You know it's you, Babe
Giving me the courage
And the strength I need
Please believe that it's true
Babe, I love you

[Verse 2]
Babe, I'm leaving
I'll say it once again
And somehow try to smile
I know the feeling
We're trying to forget
If only for a while

'Cause I'll be lonely without you
And I'll need your love to see me through
Please believe me
My heart is in your hands
'Cause I'll be missing you

441 - Escape (The Pina Colada Song):Rupert Holmes
[Verse 1]
I was tired of my lady
We'd been together too long
Like a worn out recording
Of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping
I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns
There was this letter I read:

[Chorus]
"If you like pina coladas
And getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape"

[Verse 2]
I didn't think about my lady
I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper
Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet
I thought it wasn't half bad:
 [Chorus]
"Yes, I like pina coladas
And getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
Where we'll plan our escape"

[Verse 3]
So I waited with high hopes
And she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant
I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady
And she said, "Aw, it's you"
Then we laughed for a moment
And I said, "I never knew..."

[Chorus]
"...That you like pina coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean
And the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
You're the lady I've looked for
Come with me and escape"
[Chorus]
If you like pina coladas
And getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape

[Chorus]
Yes, I like pina coladas
And getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
Where we'll plan our escape

449 - It's Still Rock and Roll to Me:Billy Joel
[Verse 1]
What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
Welcome back to the age of jive

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy 'til you spend a lot of money

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

[Verse 2]
What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set of whitewall tires?
Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental

[Chorus]
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me
 [Bridge]
Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town but you can't get the sound
From a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen

[Verse 3]
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers

[Chorus]
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
Alright Richie!

[Saxophone Solo]
Woo!
Ooh
[Verse 4]
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
Don't you know that they're out of touch?
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
If you are then you think too much

[Pre-Chorus 4]
Don't you know about the new fashion, honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money

[Chorus]
It's the next phase, new wave
Dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me12

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet

454 - Woman in Love:Barbra Streisand
[Verse 1]
Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone, it's a lonelier place
I kissed the morning goodbye
But down inside you know we never know why
The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes and the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall but I give you it all

[Chorus]
I am a woman in love and I'd do anything
To get you into my world and hold you within
It's a right I defend
Over and over again
What do I do?

[Verse 2]
With you eternally mine
In love there is no measure of time
We planned it all at the start
That you and I live in each other's heart
We may be oceans away
You feel my love, I hear what you say
No truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall but I give you it all
 [Chorus]
I am a woman in love and I'd do anything
To get you into my world and hold you within
It's a right I defend
Over and over again
What do I do?

[Chorus 2]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I am a woman in love and I'm talking to you
You know I know how you feel
What a woman can do
It's a right I defend
Over and over again

[Outro]
I am a woman in love and I'd do anything
To get you into my world and hold you within
It's a right I defend
Over and over again3

Our life together is so precious together
We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone

No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over (over)
Starting over (over)

[Verse 2]
Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy?
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by, my love
It'll be just like starting over (over)

Why don't we take off alone?
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together, all alone again
Like we used to in the early days

It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling

Starting over (over)
Look out!

We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special

459 - 9 to 5:Dolly Parton
[Verse 1]
Tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

[Chorus]
Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...

[Verse 2]
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way
 [Chorus]
Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet12

When it lights up the sky
You know it makes me feel good

Well, I love a rainy night
It's such a beautiful sight

[Verse 1]
You should've seen by the look in my eyes, baby
There was something missing
You should've known by the tone of my voice, maybe
But you didn't listen
You played dead
But you never bled
Instead you lay still in the grass
All coiled up and hissing

[Verse 2]
And though I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us, baby, way before them
And we're still together

[Pre-Chorus]
And I meant, every word I said
When I said that I love you
I meant that I love you forever

And I'm gonna keep on loving you
'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on loving you

And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture

[Verse 2]
Back to back, sacroiliac
Spineless movement and a wild attack
Face to face, sightless solitude
And it's finger popping
24-hour shopping in rapture

[Rap 1]
Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly
DJ spinnin' I said, "My My"
Flash is fast, Flash is cool
France Soir c'est pas Flash et Nous Deux
Francois c'est pas, Flash ain't no dude
And you don't stop, sure shot
Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subaru
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then, when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
Dance toe to toe, don't move too slow
'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eatin' bars, yeah wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all
Rap-ture, be pure
Take a tour through the sewer
Don't strain your brain, paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
Said don't stop to punk rock
 [Verse 3]
Man to man, body muscular
Seismic decibel, bite the jugular
Wall to wall, tea time technology
And a digital ladder
No sign of bad luck in rapture

[Rap 2]
Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars
Won't eat up bars where the TV's on
Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot
'Cause the man from Mars stopped eatin' cars
And eatin' bars and now he only eats guitars, get up

463 - Kiss on My List:Daryl Hall and John Oates
[Verse 1]
My friends wonder why I call you all the time, what can I say?
I don't feel the need to give such secrets away
You think maybe I need help, though I know I'm right, alright
I'm just better off not listening to friends' advice

[Pre-Chorus]
When they insist on knowing my bliss
I tell them this
When they wanna know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I tell them why

[Chorus]
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light

[Verse 2]
I go crazy wonderin' what there is to really see
Did the night just take up your time 'cause it means more to me
Sometimes I forget what I'm doing, I don't forget what I want, what I want
Regret what I've done, regret you? I couldn't go on
 [Pre-Chorus]
But if you insist on knowing my bliss
I'll tell you this
If you want to know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light

[Bridge]
I really miss you, babe

[Chorus]
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Oh babe, because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light

[Outro]
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Ohh, because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist5

464 - Morning Train (Nine to Five):Sheena Easton
I wake up every mornin', I stumble out of bed
Stretchin' and yawnin', another day ahead
It seems to last forever and time goes slowly by
Till babe and me's together, then it starts to fly

'Cause the moment that he's with me, time can take a flight
The moment that he's with me, everything's alright
Night time is the right time, we make love
Then it's his and my time, we take off

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

He takes me to a movie or to a restaurant
To go slow dancing, anything I want
Only when he's with me, I catch light
Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him
 All day I think of him, dreamin' of him constantly
I'm crazy mad for him and he's crazy mad for me (crazy mad for me)
When he steps off that train, amazingly full of fight
Work all day to earn his pay, so we can play all night

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

(My baby takes the morning train)
He's always on that morning train
(He works from nine to five and then)
He works so hard
(He takes another home again)
To find me waiting for him

(My baby takes the morning train)
(He works from nine to five and then)
(He takes another home again)
(To find me waitin' for him)

No reply
They said it wasn't you but I saw you peep through your window

You know if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll come back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again
 Asked a girl what she wanted to be
And she said, "Baby, can't you see?"
"I wanna be famous, a star on the screen."
"But you can do something in between!"

Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And baby, I love you

Listen, do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell?
Oh, oh-a-oh, oh
Closer, let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you (oh-a-ooh-ooh)

Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking 'til I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out
We can work it out

I should've know better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey
He's a real nowhere man, sitting in his nowhere land

You're gonna lose that girl
You're gonna lose that girl
You're gonna lose that girl

The Stars On 45 keep on turning in your mind
Like "We Can Work It Out"
Remember "Twist and Shout"
You still don't "Tell Me Why" and "No Reply"

Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way 'cross town
Wondering to yourself, "Hey, what've I found?"

Arthur, he does as he pleases
All of his life, his master's toys
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a pretty good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the moon and New York City

[Intro]
Come on!

[Verse 1]
Does she walk? Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Years go by
I'm looking through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in-between

My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold (Woo!)
My memory has just been sold
Angel is the centerfold
 [Verse 2]
Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinking about her dress
I was shy, I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shaking in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

I'll see you when your clothes are on
Take your car, yes, we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private

[Pre-Chorus 3]
A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can't deny it
Oh yeah, I guess I gotta buy it

Suckin' on a chili dog outside the Tastee Freez
Diane's sittin' on Jacky's lap, he's got his hand between her knees
Jacky say, "Hey Diane, lets run off behind a shady tree
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks slacks, now do what I please"
Say a....

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
I say, oh yeah say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Now walk on

[Verse 3]
Jacky sits back, collects his thoughts for the moment
Scratches his head and does his best James Dean
"Well then, there Diane, we ought to run off to the city"
Diane says, "Baby, you ain't missin' nothing"
But Jacky say a...
 [Chorus]
Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah I say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

[Bridge]
Gonna let it rock, let it roll
Let the Bible Belt come and save my soul
Holdin on to sixteen as long as you can
Changes come around real soon
Make us women and men

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah they say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

[Outro]

477 - Who Can It Be Now:Men at Work
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Who can it be knocking at my door?
Go 'way, don't come 'round here no more
Can't you see that it's late at night?
I'm very tired, and I'm not feeling right
All I wish is to be alone;
Stay away, don't you invade my home
Best off if you hang outside
Don't come in, I'll only run and hide

[Chorus]
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?

[Verse 2]
Who can it be knocking at my door?
Make no sound, tip-toe across the floor
If he hears, he'll knock all day
I'll be trapped, and here I'll have to stay
I've done no harm, I keep to myself;
There's nothing wrong with my state of mental health
I like it here with my childhood friend;
Here they come, those feelings again!
 [Chorus]
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?

[Post-Chorus]
Is it the man come to take me away?
Why do they follow me?
It's not the future that I can see
It's just my fantasy
Yeah!

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?

Oh, who can it be now?
Oh, who can it, who can it
Oh, who can it be now?
Oh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh...

[Verse 1]
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In a world few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real, I keep it alive

[Refrain]
The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

[Chorus]
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear winds blow

[Verse 1]
Some hang on to "used to be"
Live their lives looking behind
All we have is here and now
All our life, out there to find

[Refrain]
The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day
 [Chorus]
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear winds blow

[Bridge]
Time goes by
No time to cry
Life's you and I
Alive today

Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high

Traveling in a fried-out Kombi
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said

Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover

Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six-foot-four and full of muscle
I said, "Do you speak-a my language?"
And he just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich

Where beer does flow and men chunder

[Verse 1: Patti Austin]
Thinkin' back in time
When love was only in my mind, I realize
Ain't no second chance
You've got to hold on to romance
Don't let it slide
There's a special kind of magic in the air
When you find another heart that needs to share

[Chorus]
Baby, come to me
Let me put my arms around you

Gotta have your love around me
Baby, always stay
'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you

[Verse 2: James Ingram]
Spendin' every dime to keep you talkin' on the line
That's how it was
And all those walks together out in any kind of weather
Just because
There's a brand new way of looking at your life
When you know that love is standing by your side
 [Chorus]
Baby, come to me
Let me put my arms around you

And I'm, oh, so glad I found you (I'm so glad that I found you)

Cause I can't go back to livin' without you (Mmm)

483 - Billie Jean:Michael Jackson
[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh), hey-ey

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hoo)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)
 [Pre-Chorus 2]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (Don't break no hearts; hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo), hey-ey

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (Hoo)
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)

But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one (No)

Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl)
Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl; don't call me Billie Jean, hoo)

489 - Maniac:Michael Sembello
[Verse 1]
Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real-time world, no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy
Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

[Chorus 1]
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

[Verse 2]
On the ice-blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard-won place of mystery
Touch it, but can't hold it
You work all your life for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push-shove world, but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night
 [Pre-Chorus 2]
There's a cold kinetic heat
Struggling, stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind

[Chorus 2]
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

[Bridge]
Ooh, oh
Oh

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

[Chorus 2]
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
Maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before21

490 - Tell Her About It:Billy Joel
[Verse 1]
Listen boy I don't want to see you let a good thing slip away
You know I don't like watching anybody make the same mistakes I made

[Bridge 1]
She's a real nice girl and she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do

[Verse 2]
Oh, listen boy I'm sure that you think you got it all under control
You don't want somebody telling you the way to stay in someone's soul

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're a big boy now and you'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing she ought to know

[Chorus 1]
Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that you're for real
Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her, let her know how much she means

[Verse 3]
Listen boy it's not automatically a certain guarantee
To ensure yourself you've got to provide communication constantly
[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you love someone, you're always insecure
And there's only one good way to reassure

[Chorus 2]
Tell her about it, let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you, tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it, every day before you leave
Pay her some attention, give her something to believe

[Bridge 2]
Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken for so long
And though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone?

[Verse 4]
Listen boy it's good information from a man who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you could be the difference that it makes

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She's a trusting soul, she's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you what you should do

[Chorus 1]
Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that you're for real
Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her, let her know how much she means
 [Outro]
Tell her about it, tell her how you feel right now
Just tell her about it, the girl don't want to wait too long
You got to tell her about it, tell her now and you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it, before it gets too late
You've got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want to wait
You got to tell her about it
You got to tell, tell, tell her about it
Now, tell her about it5

492 - Islands in the Stream:Kenny Rogers with Dolly Parton
Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah ha
Making love with each other, ah ha
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong?
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, ah ha
Making love with each other, ah ha
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong?
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha
Sail away
Oh, come sail away with me
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong?
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong?
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between

495 - Owner of a Lonely Heart:Yes
[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Move yourself
You always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself
You are the move you make
Take your chances, win or loser
See yourself
You are the steps you take
You and you, and that's the only way
Shake, shake yourself
You're every move you make
So the story goes

[Chorus]

Owner of a broken heart

I know (x3)

[Verse 2]
Say - you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before
Watch it now
The eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only
You, lose yourself
No not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
(Much better than a)
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

They confused me so
Owner of a lonely heart
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go
Look before you leap
Owner of a lonely heart
And don't you hesitate at all - no no
Yow!
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!

Will decide the lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
It will excite, it will delight
It will give a better start
Owner of a lonely heart

Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
Owner of a lonely heart
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it
Just receive it
(Owner of a lonely heart)

I love you

Lyin' in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you picture me, I'm walkin' too far ahead
You're callin' to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, "Go slow", I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting

If you fall, I will catch you, (I'll be waiting) I will be waiting

Watchin' through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside

[Verse 1]
You've gone too far this time
But I'm dancing on the Valentine
I tell you somebody's fooling around
With my chances on the danger line

I'll cross that bridge when I find it
Another day to make my stand, oh woah
High time is no time for deciding
If I should find a helping hand, oh woah

I'm on a ride, and I want to get off
But they won't slow down the roundabout
I sold the Renoir and TV set
Don't wanna be around when this gets out

Buy time, don't lose it

Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling?
Can you picture this?

An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding

Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like

Feel how it trembles inside (Mhm)

Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold

Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (Never, never satisfied, why scream?)
Why do we scream at each other? (Why?)
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
[Break]
When doves cry (When doves cry, when doves cry)
When doves cry (When doves cry, they cry)
Oh, no, oh
Oh, no, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
When doves cry
When doves cry (Hoo)
When doves cry (Hoo)
Baby, baby, baby, yeah

[Outro]
When doves cry (When doves cry, when doves cry)
Don't cry
Darling, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't, don't cry33

504 - What's Love Got to Do with It:Tina Turner
[Verse 1]
You must understand, oh, the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meetin' girl
Opposites attract

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that
Oh

[Chorus]
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

[Verse 2]
It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed, I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason, you do it for me
Oh
 [Chorus]
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
Ooh

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
I've been takin' on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way
Oh

[Chorus]
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
(What's love?) Got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a sweet old-fashioned notion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
[Outro]
(What's love got to do?) Ooh, got to do with it
(What's love but a second-hand emotion?)
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
(What's love?) Ooh, ooh
(Got to do with it) Got to do with it
(What's love?) But a second-hand emotion11

505 - Missing You:John Waite
[Intro]
Missing you, missing you
Missing you, missing you
Missing you, missing you
Missing you, missing you

[Verse 1]
Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left

[Verse 2]
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
 [Chorus]
I ain't missing you at all
(Missing you, missing you)
Since you've been gone away
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
No matter what I might say
(Missing you, missing you)

[Verse 3]
There's a message in the wire
And I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know
How desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world
I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

[Chorus]
I ain't missing you at all
(Missing you, missing you)
Since you've been gone away
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
No matter what my friends say
(Missing you, missing you)
[Bridge]
And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload

[Chorus]
I ain't missing you at all
(Missing you, missing you)
Since you've been gone away
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
No matter what my friends say
(Missing you, missing you)

I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
I keep lying to myself
(Missing you, missing you)

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
[Chorus]
I ain't missing you at all
(Missing you, missing you)
Since you've been gone away
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
No matter what my friends say

[Outro]
Ain't missing you
(Missing you)
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I keep lying to myself
(Missing you)
Ain't missing you

I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
Ain't missing you

Oh no

No matter what my friends might say
I ain't missing you

506 - Let's Go Crazy:Prince and The Revolution
[Intro]
Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called "life"
Electric word, life
It means forever, and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else:
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-All-Right
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, babe
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor)
Whoo

[Verse 1]
If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see, I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
"Ah, ah," is all I heard
 [Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh no, let's go

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go

[Verse 2]
We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for? (What's it all for?)
You better live now
'Fore the grim reaper come knocking on your door

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh no, let's go

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go
[Bridge]
C'mon, baby
Let's get nuts
Yeah
(Crazy)
Let's go crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh no, let's go
Go (Go crazy)

[Bridge]
I said let's go crazy (Go crazy)
Let's go (Let's go)
Go (Let's go)

[Verse 3]
Dr. Everything'll-Be-All-Right
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough, children
He's coming
He's coming
Coming
[Guitar solo]

[Outro]
Take me away14

507 - I Just Called to Say I Love You:Stevie Wonder
[Verse 1]
No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact, here's just another ordinary day

[Verse 2]
No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, it's something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

[Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

[Verse 3]
No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

[Verse 4]
No Libra sun, no Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old, so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
 [Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
I just called to say I love you (Yeah)
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart
Baby, of my heart22

508 - Caribbean Queen (No More Love on the Run):Billy Ocean
[Intro]
She's simply awesome
Ooh

[Verse 1]
She dashed by me in painted on jeans
And all heads turned 'cause she was the dream
In the blink of an eye I knew her number and her name, yeah
She said I was the tiger she wanted to tame

[Chorus]
Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

[Verse 2]
I lose my cool when she steps in the room
And I get so excited just from her perfume
Electric eyes that you can't ignore
And passion burns you like never before

[Verse 3]
I was in search of a good time
Just running my game
Love was the furthest
Furthest from my mind
 [Chorus]
Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

[Chorus]
Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream

And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run
[Outro]
She is the queen
My Caribbean Queen
I said she dashed by me in painted jeans...5

510 - Out of Touch:Daryl Hall and John Oates
[Intro]
Hey, y'all, whoo!
I don't care if you got no legs!
Dance on your knees!
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (time)

[Verse 1]
Shake it up is all that we know
Using the bodies up as we go
I'm waking up to fantasy
The shades all around aren't the colors we used to see
Broken ice still melts in the sun
And times that are broken can often be one again
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Take a look around

[Chorus]
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
 [Verse 2]
Reaching out for something to hold
Looking for a love where the climate is cold
Manic moves and drowsy dreams
Or living in the middle between the two extremes
Smoking guns hot to the touch
Would cool down if we didn't
Use them so much, yeah
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Too much

[Chorus]
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Ooh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Interlude]
(Out of touch, out of touch
Out of touch, out of touch)
Wow!

Ow, you're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch (We're soul alone, girl)
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
(Out of touch, out of time, out of touch, out of time, girl)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch (Reach out for something to hold)
Time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
(You're too cold, girl, too cold, girl, too cold, girl, yeah)
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
Not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
(Out of touch, out of time, out of touch, out of time)
(Out of touch, out of time, girl)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
Yeah, I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time...21

I've gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older

Now, this mountain, I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds, I see love shine

Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

513 - Careless Whisper:Wham! featuring George Michael
[Intro]
Time can never mend
The careless whispers
Of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find
Should've known better, yeah

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I feel so unsure
As I take your hand
And lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

[Verse 2]
Time can never mend
The careless whispers
Of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
(Should've known better, yeah)
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Never without your love

[Bridge]
Tonight, the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

[Chorus]
And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

[Outro]
(Now that you're gone)
Now that you're gone
(Now that you're gone)
Was what I did so wrong, so wrong
That you had to leave me alone?

514 - Can't Fight This Feeling:REO Speedwagon
[Verse 1]
Oh, I can't fight this feeling any longer
And yet, I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship, has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show
I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

[Pre-Chorus]
And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

[Chorus]
And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore
 [Verse 2]
My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running round in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places that, alone, I'd never find

[Pre-Chorus]
And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

[Chorus]
And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore5

One more night, one more night
One more night, ooh, ooh, ooh

I've been trying, ooh, so long to let you know
Let you know how I feel
And if I stumble, if I fall, just help me back
So I can make you see

[Chorus]
Please give me one more night, give me one more night
One more night 'cause I can't wait forever (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Give me just one more night, uh, just one more night
Oh, one more night 'cause I can't wait forever (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Oh, one more night, 'cause I can't wait forever (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Please give me one more night, ooh, just one more night

And if you sail away, I will follow you

[Chorus]
Give me one more night, give me just one more night
Oh, one more night, 'cause I can't wait forever (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 3]
I know there'll never be a time you'll ever feel the same
And I know it's only words
But if you change your mind, you know that I'll be here
And maybe we both can learn

[Chorus]
Give me just one more night, give me just one more night
Ooh, one more night, 'cause I can't wait forever (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Give me just one more night, give me just one more night
Ooh, one more night, 'cause I can't wait forever (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth, you know
Love is all we need

[Chorus: Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, Both]
We are the world, we are the children

Just you and me

[Verse 3: Dionne Warwick, Willie Nelson, Al Jarreau, Dionne Warwick & Willie Nelson]
Well, send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stone to bread
And so we all must lend a helping hand

We are the world, we are the children

When you're down and out, and there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe, there's no way we can fall

Let us realize, oh, that a change can only come
When we stand together as one (Yeah yeah yeah yeah!)

517 - Crazy for You:Madonna
[Verse 1]
Swaying room, as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two, their bodies become one
I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare?
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

[Chorus]
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you

[Verse 2]
Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all
Slowly now, we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
You'll feel it in my kiss

Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this

You'll feel it in my kiss

Won't you come see about me?
I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby

[Intro]
Uh, huh-huh
Oh yeah
Work

[Verse 1]
Somebody told me
"Boy, everything she wants, is everything she sees"
I guess I must have loved you
Because I said you were the perfect girl for me, maybe

Some people work for fun
Girl, I just work for you
They told me marriage was a give and take
Well, you've shown me you can take, you've got some giving to do
And now you tell me that you're having my baby
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
But one step further, and my back will break
If my best isn't good enough
Then how can it be good enough for two?

Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo-doo-doo
I can't work any harder than I do (La, la, la, la-la)

[Verse 1]
Meeting you with a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places, feel the chill

Nightfall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making
Still overseas, could it be the whole Earth opening wide
A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside
A week is why, until we...

To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

The choice for you is the view to a kill
Between the shades assassination standing still

Earth's crystal tears, the fall of snowflakes on your body
First time in years to drench your skin in lover's rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die, but can we...
 [Chorus]
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

When all we see is the view to a kill11

526 - The Power of Love:Huey Lewis and the News
[Verse 1]
The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling; that's the power of love

Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good make a wrong one right
Power of love that keeps you home at night

[Chorus]
You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love
That's the power of love

[Verse 3]
First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it, it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found
That's the power makes the world go'round
 [Chorus 2]
And it don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

[Bridge]
They say that all in love is fair
Yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Can you feel it?
Hmmm

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
It don't take money and it don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
You won't feel nothin' till you feel
You feel the power, just feel the power of love
That's the power, that's the power of love
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Feel the power of love4

But maybe sometime if you feel the pain
You'll find you're all alone, everything has changed

530 - Saving All My Love for You:Whitney Houston
[Verse 1]
A few stolen moments is all that we shared
You've got your family and they need you there
Though I try to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

[Verse 2]
It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try, I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

[Bridge]
You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said, "Be patient, just wait a little longer."
But that's just an old fantasy

[Verse 3]
I've got to get ready
Just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling
When you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for a feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
 [Verse 4]
No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah, I'm saving all my loving
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
For you, for you17

531 - Part-Time Lover:Stevie Wonder
[Verse 1: Stevie Wonder]
Call up, ring once, hang up the phone
To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover
If she's with me, I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you, my part-time lover

[Chorus]
We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

[Verse 2]
If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word's "discreet" with part-time lovers
But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek it's really you my part-time lover

[Chorus]
We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right
 [Bridge: Luther Vandross, (Part-Time Lovers)]
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-pa-da-da-da

(Part-time lovers)

[Chorus]
We are undercover passion on the run, yeah
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

[Verse 3]
I've got something that I must tell
Last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you, my part-time lover
And then a man called our exchange
But didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game
Of part-time lovers
You and me, part-time lovers
But, she and he, part-time lovers

[Outro]

532 - We Built This City:Starship
[Chorus]
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

[Verse 1]
Say you don't know me
Or recognize my face
Say you don't care who goes
To that kind of place
Knee deep in the hoopla
Sinking in your fight
Too many runaways
Eating up the night

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?

Corporation names
We just want to dance here
Someone stole the stage
They call us irresponsible
Write us off the page

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

[Chorus]
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

[Verse 3]
It's just another Sunday
In a tired old street
Police have got the choke hold, oh
And we just lost the beat
Who counts the money
Underneath the bar
Who rides the wrecking ball
Into our guitars
Don't tell us you need us
'Cause we're the ship of fools
Looking for America
Coming through your schools
[Bridge]
I'm looking out over that Golden Gate bridge
On another gorgeous sunny Saturday
And I'm seeing that bumper to bumper traffic
Don't you remember? ('Member, 'member)
It's your favorite radio station
In your favorite radio city
The city by the bay, the city that rocks
The city that never sleeps

[Pre-Chorus]
Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

[Chorus]

533 - Separate Lives:Phil Collins and Marilyn Martin
[Verse 1]
You called me from the room in your hotel
All full of romance for someone that you met
And telling me how sorry you were, leaving so soon
And that you miss me sometimes when you're alone in your room
Do I feel lonely too?

[Chorus]
You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me, so kind
I can't go on just holding on to ties
Now that we're living separate lives

[Verse 2]
Well, I held on to let you go
And if you lost your love for me, well you never let it show
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living (living)
Separate lives

[Bridge]
Ooh, it's so typical, love leads to isolation
So you build that wall (build that wall)
Yes, you build that wall (build that wall)
And you make it stronger
 [Chorus]
You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me, so kind
I can't go on just holding on to ties
Now that we're living separate lives2

534 - Broken Wings:Mr. Mister
[Verse 1]
Baby, don't understand
Why we can't just hold on to each other's hands?
This time might be the last I fear unless
I make it all too clear I need you so, ohh

[Chorus]
Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings

Baby, I think tonight
We can take what was wrong and make it right
Baby, it's all I know that you're half of the flesh
And blood that makes me whole, I need you so

[Chorus]
So take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
When we hear the voices sing

When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in

[Chorus Intro]
Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

I had a dream, I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out

[Chorus]
Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

Say you, say me
Say it for always, (Oh) that's the way it should be
Say you, say me

Say you, say me
Say it for always, (Oh) that's the way it should be

Kyrie eleison
Kyrie eleison
Kyrie

[Verse 1]
The wind blows hard against this mountain side
Across the sea into my soul
It reaches into where I cannot hide
Setting my feet upon the road

[Verse 2]
My heart is old, it holds my memories
My body burns a gemlike flame
Somewhere between the soul and soft machine
Is where I find myself again

[Chorus]
Kyrie eleison, down the road that I must travel
Kyrie eleison, through the darkness of the night
Kyrie eleison, where I'm going, will you follow?
Kyrie eleison, on a highway in the light

When I was young I thought of growing old
Of what my life would mean to me
Would I have followed down my chosen road
Or only wished what I could be

Kyrie eleison, through the darkness of the night
Kyrie eleison, where I'm going, will you follow?

Don't look back
We've drawn the line

540 - These Dreams:Heart
[Verse 1]
Spare a little candle, save some light for me
Figures up ahead moving in the trees
White skin in linen, perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over these dreams in the mist

[Verse 2]
Darkness on the edge, shadows where I stand (Shadows where I stand)
I search for the time on a watch with no hands
I want to see you clearly, come closer than this (All that I remember)
But all I remember are the dreams in the mist

[Chorus]
These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night, I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake, the further I'm away (The further I'm away)

[Verse 3]
Is it cloak-and-dagger? Could it be spring or fall?
I walk without a cut through a stained-glass wall (Weaker in my eyesight)
Weaker in my eyesight, the candle in my grip (Words that have no form)
And words that have no form are falling from my lips

[Chorus]
These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night, I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake, the further I'm away (The further I'm away)
 [Bridge]
There's something out there, I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there, I can't resist

[Verse 4]
The sweetest song is silence that I've ever heard (Feet don't touch the earth)
Funny how your feet in dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes, freedom is a kiss (The prince hides his face)
But the prince hides his face from dreams in the mist

[Chorus]
These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night, I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake, the further I'm away
These dreams go on when I close my eyes (Every single sec)
Every second of the night, I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake, the further I'm away

541 - Kiss:Prince and The Revolution

I just need your body, baby, from dusk 'til dawn
You don't need experience to turn me out
You just leave it all up to me, I'm gonna show you what it's all about

[Chorus]
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss

[Verse 2]
You got to not talk dirty, baby, if you wanna impress me
You can't be too flirty, mama, I know how to undress me
I want to be your fantasy, maybe you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me, we could have a good time

You don't have to watch "Dynasty" to have an attitude
You just leave it all up to me, my love will be your food

You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm compatible with

542 - Addicted to Love:Robert Palmer
[Verse 1]
The lights are on, but you're not home
Your mind is not your own
Your heart sweats, your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes

You can't sleep, you can't eat
There's no doubt, you're in deep
Your throat is tight, you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need

[Chorus]
Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're going to have to face it, you're addicted to love

[Verse 2]
You see the signs, but you can't read
You're running at a different speed
Your heart beats in double time
Another kiss and you'll be mine

A one-track mind, you can't be saved
Oblivion is all you crave
If there's some left for you
You don't mind if you do
 [Chorus]
Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're going to have to face it, you're addicted to love

Might as well face it, you're addicted to love

Your lights are on, but you're not home
Your will is not your own
Your heart sweats your teeth grind
Another kiss and you'll be mine

It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're going to have to face it, you're addicted to love

543 - West End Girls:Pet Shop Boys
[Verse 1: Neil Tennant]
Sometimes you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand, and it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad, too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant in a West End town
Call the police, there's a madman around
Running down underground to a dive bar
In a West End town

[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
West End girls

[Verse 2: Neil Tennant & Helena Springs]
Too many shadows, whispering voices
Faces on posters, too many choices
If, when, why, what?
How much have you got?
Have you got it, do you get it, if so, how often?
And which do you choose, a hard or soft option?
(How much do you need?)
 [Chorus: Neil Tennant]
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead end world

[Verse 3: Neil Tennant & Helena Springs]
You've got a heart of glass or a heart of stone
Just you wait 'til I get you home
We've got no future, we've got no past
Here today, built to last
In every city, in every nation
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station
(How far have you been?)
[Chorus: Neil Tennant & Helena Springs]
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
A West End town, a dead end world

544 - Greatest Love of All:Whitney Houston
[Verse 1]
I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

[Pre-Chorus]
I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

[Chorus]
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all
 [Verse 2]
I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

[Chorus]
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

[Outro]
And if, by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love15

545 - Live to Tell:Madonna
[Verse 1]
I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Verse 2]
I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Post-Chorus]
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?
 [Bridge]
If I ran away, I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?
How will they hear? When will they learn? How will they know?

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Post-Chorus]
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me6

546 - On My Own:Patti LaBelle and Michael McDonald
[Verse 1: Patti LaBelle]
So many times
Said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew
I'd be lying here beside you

On my own
On my own
On my own

[Verse 2: Michael McDonald]
So many promises never should be spoken
Now I know what loving you cost
Now we're up to talking divorce
And we weren't even married

[Patti LaBelle]
On my own
Once again now
One more time
By myself
No one said it was easy
No

[Bridge: Michael McDonald]
But it once was so easy
 [Patti LaBelle & Michael McDonald]
Well, I believed in love (I believe)
Now here I stand
I wonder why
Ooh

[Chorus: Patti LaBelle]
I'm on my own
Why did it end this way
(On my own)
This wasn't how it was supposed to be
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again

[Verse 3: Michael McDonald]
So many times
I know I could have told you
Losing you
It cut like a knife
Hey
You walked out and there went my life
I don't want to live without you

[Patti LaBelle & Michael McDonald]
On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to end
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again
On my own
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone
By myself
On my own
I've got to find out where I belong again
I've got to learn to be strong again
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone
By myself, by myself, by myself
I've got to find out what was mine again
My heart is saying that it's time again
And I have faith that I will shine again
By myself
I have faith in me
Oh
I know I'll make it
By myself, by myself1

547 - There'll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry):Billy Ocean
[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wonder, by the look in your eye
When I'm standing besides, there's a fever burning deep inside
Is there another in your memory
Do you think of someone you hear that special melody?
I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you (I love you)

[Verse 2]
I often wonder, how it could be
You loving me, two hearts in perfect harmony
I'll count the hours until that day
Rhapsody plays, a melody for you and me
Until the moment that you give your love to me
You're the one I care for, the one that I would wait for

[Chrous]
There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new

Saying I love you
 Ooo-ooo-ooo

You take me higher
My love is like a river running so deep
I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

[Chrous]
There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you (I love you)
There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you (I love you)

Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say

In time, you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you

Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames

Won't you please forgive me
I wouldn't ever try to hurt you
I just needed someone to hold me
To fill the void while you were gone
To fill this space of emptiness

I'm only human
Of flesh and blood I'm made
Human
Born to make mistakes

So many times I looked and saw your face
Nothing could change the way I feel
No one else could ever take your place

I'm only human
Of flesh and blood I'm made
Human
Born to make mistakes
(I am just a man) Human
(Human) Please forgive me
 [Interlude: Joanne Catherall]
The tears I cry aren't tears of pain
They're all to hide my guilt and shame
I forgive you, now I ask the same of you
While we were apart, I was human too

[Chorus: Philip Oakey]
(Human
Human)
I'm only human
Of flesh and blood I'm made (I am just a man)
Human
Born to make mistakes

565 - At This Moment:Billy Vera and the Beaters
What did you think I would do at this moment
When you're standing before me
With tears in your eyes
Trying to tell me that you have found you another
And you just don't love me no more

What did you think I would say at this moment
When I'm faced with the knowledge
That you just don't love me
Did you think I would curse you
Or say things to hurt you
'cause you just don't love me no more

Did you think I could hate you
Or raise my hands to you
Now come on you know me too well
How could I hurt you when darling I love you
And you know I'd never hurt you-oo-wo-oo-o-o-o...

What do you think I would give at this moment

And kiss the ground that you walk on
If I could just hold you again

I'd fall down on my knees
And kiss the ground that you walk on baby

Like a warrior that fights and wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights consumed by the shadows
I was crippled emotionally

One touch and you set me free

[Intro]
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

[Verse 1]
I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary, it sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

[Chorus]
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
[Verse 2]
Is there any just 'cause for feeling like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times
 [Chorus]
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away
[Bridge]
It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over the moment has gone
I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away26

On our way home
We were in for a surprise
Who would have known?

578 - Alone:Heart
[Verse 1]
I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here, the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh, I hope that it won't end though
Alone

[Chorus]
'Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

[Verse 2]
You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh
You don't know how long I have waited
And I was gonna tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone

'Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

[Verse 1]
No matter what you think you've pulled
You'll find it's not enough
No matter who you think you know
You won't get through
It's a given, L.A. law
Someone's faster on the draw
No matter where you hide
I'm comin' after you

[Verse 2]
No matter how the race is run
It always ends the same
Another room without a view
Awaits downtown
You can shake me for a while
Live it up in style
No matter what you do
I'm going to take you down

[Chorus]
Shakedown, breakdown, takedown
Everybody wants into the crowded light
Breakdown, takedown
You're busted
Let down your guard, honey
Just about the time you figured it's alright
Breakdown, take down
You're busted (Oh, oh, uh)
 [Verse 3]
This is a town where everyone
Is reaching for the top
This is a place where
Second best will never do
It's okay you want to shine
But once you step across that line
No matter where you hide
I'm comin' after you

Shakedown, breakdown, takedown
Everybody wants into the crowded light
Breakdown, takedown

I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

[Chorus]
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

[Verse 2]
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

[Verse 3]
I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still running
You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believe it

[Chorus]
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

Remember when we held on in the rain
The nights we almost lost it
Once again, we can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you, I feel it all again

[Chorus]
Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend

The nights we hold on 'til the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all?

We kept our hearts together down the line
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again

The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all?

Didn't we have the best of times
When love was young and new?
Couldn't we reach inside and find
The world of me and you?
We'll never lose it again
Because once you know what love is
You never let it end

[Chorus]
Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all?

You know you'll never love that way again

There doesn't seem to be anyone around

'Cause what would they say
If they ever knew?

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Well, I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
I know not everybody has got a body like you
But I gotta think twice before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play because I played them too

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, when that love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man, baby
But I'm showin' you the door

[Chorus]
'Cause I gotta' have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I got to have faith, faith, faith

[Verse 2]
Baby, I know you're askin' me to stay
Say, "Please, please, please don't go away"
You say I'm givin' you the blues
Maybe (Huh) you mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules
 [Pre-Chorus]
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh, baby, I reconsider my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for somethin' more

Yes I gotta have faith
Ooh, I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith

When I think about
What could've been
Makes me want to cry

The sweet words you whispered didn't mean a thing
I guess our song is over
As we began to sing

Every day of my life
Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right

What could've been on a cold and lonely night

[Verse 2]
The memories of our loving still linger in the air
Like the faded scent of your roses
Stay with me everywhere
 Everytime I get my hopes up
They always seem to fall
Still what could've been
Is better than what can never be at all
At all

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
Could've been my lover
Every day of my life

We know the game, and we're gonna play it

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up

601 - Where Do Broken Hearts Go:Whitney Houston
[Verse 1]
I know it's been some time
But there's something on my mind
You see, I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I learned
Is that I need you desperately

[Pre-Chorus]
So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh

[Chorus]
Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me
Ooh, baby

[Verse 2]
I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind
 [Pre-Chorus]
So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh

[Chorus]
Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me

[Bridge]
And now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know

[Chorus]
Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care
Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me, for me
[Outro]
You still care for me2

602 - Wishing Well:Terence Trent D'Arby
[Verse 1]
Kissing like a bandit, stealing time
Underneath a sycamore tree
Cupid by the hour sends valentines
To my sweet lover and me
Slowly but surely
Your appetite is more than I knew
Sweetly, softly
I'm falling in love with you

[Chorus]
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers, sing

[Post-Chorus]
Make it funky now, boys

[Verse 2]
Hugging like a monkey see, monkey do
Right beside a riverboat gambler, hahaha
Erotic images float through my head
Say you wanna be a midnight rambler
(I wanna be a midnight rambler)
Quickly, but quickly
The blood races through my veins
Quickly, loudly
I wanna hear those sugar bells ring
 [Chorus]
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers, get up

[Post-Chorus]
On the beat now, uh
Come on

Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears, come on
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers, uh

[Outro]
(Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell)
Yeah, I feel like goin' on, I feel like goin' on

Come on, come on
Erotic images float through here
Your midnight rambler, baby, uh
(Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell)
Yeah, hoo, dig it, follow you anywhere
I don't know, I don't care
(Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell)
But all I know is that I gotta be a midnight rambler, baby, uh1

603 - Anything for You:Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine
Anything for you
Though you're not here
Since you said we're through
It seems like years
Time keeps dragging on and on
And forever's been and gone
Still I can't figure what went wrong

I'd still do anything for you
I'll play your game
You hurt me through and through
But you can have your way

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care
And I don't need you
And though you'll never see me crying
You know inside I feel like dying

And I'd do anything for you
In spite of it all
I've learned so much from you
You made me strong

But don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye
 I hope you find someone to please you
Someone who'll care and never leave you
But if that someone ever hurts you
You just might need a friend to turn to

And I'd do anything for you
I'll give you up
If that's what I should do
To make you happy

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though inside I feel like dying
You know you'll never see me crying

Don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye1

604 - One More Try:George Michael
[Verse 1]
I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm lookin' out for angels
Just tryin' to find some peace
Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you don't, just let me go

[Chorus]
'Cause teacher, there are things
That I don't wanna learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't wanna learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 2]
When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Tellin' me "No"
So you think that you love me and know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong, just let me go
 [Chorus]
And teacher, there are things
That I don't wanna learn
Oh, the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't wanna learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]
So when you say that you need me, that you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong, let me go

[Chorus]
And teacher, there are things
That I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh, so I don't wanna learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Who just isn't willin' to try

[Outro]
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more try7

605 - Together Forever:Rick Astley
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
If there's anything you need
All you have to do is say
You know you satisfy everything in me
We shouldn't waste a single day

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So don't stop me falling, it's destiny calling
A power I just can't deny
It's never changing, can't you hear me, I'm saying

Together forever we're two
And don't you know I would move heaven and earth

I'll always do what's best for you

Something to last for all time
It's never changing, can't you hear me, I'm saying

Together forever we're two
And don't you know I would move heaven and earth

To be together forever with you?
Together forever and never to part
Together forever we're two
And don't you know I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you?8

606 - Foolish Beat:Debbie Gibson
[Verse 1]
There was a time when
Broken hearts and broken dreams
Were over
There was a place where
All you could do was
Wish on a four leaf clover

But now is a new time
There is a new place
Where dreams just can't come true
It started the day when I left you

[Chorus]
I could never love again the way that I loved you
I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart
(Without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart

[Verse 2]
When I was sorry
It was too late to turn around
And tell you so
There was no reason
There was no reason
Just a foolish beat of my heart
 [Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh, can't you see I'm not fooling nobody
Don't you see the tears are falling down my face?
Since you went away
Break my heart, you slipped away
Didn't know I was wrong
Never meant to hurt you now you're gone

I could never love again now that we're apart
(Now that we're apart)
I could never love again now that we're apart1

607 - Dirty Diana:Michael Jackson
[Verse 1]
You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time, you won't seduce me

[Pre-Chorus]
She's saying "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says "There's no turning back"
She trapped me in her heart

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no, oh no, oh no
 [Verse 2]
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

[Pre-Chorus]
She's saying "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star"

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
[Interlude]
Diana
Diana
Dirty Diana
It's Diana, -iana, -iana
C'mon!

[Verse 3]
She said "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright"

[Pre-Chorus]
Diana walked up to me
She said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that, I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright"
I said "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key"
She said "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me"
[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

[Outro]
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)

608 - The Flame:Cheap Trick
[Verse 1]
Another night slowly closes in
And I feel so lonely
Touching heat freezing on my skin
I pretend you still hold me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep
I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you
I can't believe you're gone
You were the first, you'll be the last

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone
To lay your heart and head upon
Remember after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame

[Verse 2]
Watching shadows move across the wall
Feels so frightening
I wanna run to you, I wanna call
But I've been hit by lightning
 [Pre-Chorus]
Just can't stand up for fallin' apart
Can't see through this veil across my heart over you
You'll always be the one
You were the first, you'll be the last

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone
To lay your heart and head upon
Remember after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep
I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you
You'll always be the one
You were the first, you'll be the last

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone
To lay your heart and head upon
Remember after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame
[Outro]
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Wherever you go, I'll be with you
And whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Oh, whatever you want, I'll give it to you1

609 - Hold On to the Nights:Richard Marx
[Verse 1]
Just when I believed
I couldn't ever want for more
This ever-changing world
Pushes me through another door

I saw you smile
And my mind
Could not erase the beauty of your face
Just for awhile
Won't you let me shelter you

[Chorus]
Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you
Something more
That I could be yours

[Verse 2]
How do we explain
Something that took us by surprise
Promises in vain
Love that is real
But in disguise
 What happens now
Do we break another rule?
Let our lovers play the fool?
I don't know how
To stop feeling this way

[Chorus]
Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
If only I could give you more

[Bridge]
Well, I think that I've been true
To everybody else but me
And the way I feel about you
Makes my heart long to be free

Every time I look into your eyes
I'm helplessly aware
That the someone I've been searching for
Is right there

[Chorus]
Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you more
That I can be yours

610 - Roll with It:Steve Winwood
[Verse 1]
When life is too much, roll with it, baby
Don't stop and lose your touch, oh no, baby
Hard times knocking on your door
I'll tell them you ain't there no more
Get on through it, roll with it, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Luck'll come and then slip away
You've gotta move, bring it back to stay

[Chorus]
You just roll with it, baby
Come on and just roll with it, baby
You and me, roll with it, baby
Hang on and just roll with it, baby, hey

[Verse 2]
The way that you love is good as money
I swear by stars above, sweet as honey
People think you're down and out
You show them what it's all about
You can make it, roll with it, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
When this world turns its back on you
Hang in and do that sweet thing you do
 [Chorus]
You just roll with it, baby, yeah
You just roll with it, baby

You and me, just roll with it, baby

Roll with it, baby, yeah
You just roll with it, baby
You and me, just roll with it, baby
Come on and just roll with it, baby

[Verse 3]
Hey, now there'll be a day you'll get there, baby
You'll hear the music play, you'll dance, baby
You'll leave bad times way behind
Nothing but good times on your mind
You can do it, roll with it, baby

[Bridge]
Then you'll see life will be so nice
It's just a step up to paradise

[Chorus]
You just roll with it, baby, yeah
You just roll with it, baby
You and me, just roll with it, baby
Come on and just roll with it, baby
Hey, come on
Roll with me, baby

Roll, roll, roll with me baby, roll
Hey, c'mon and roll
Come roll with me, baby
Come and roll
Hang on and just roll, hey and roll2

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?

Do you love your monkey or do you love me?
Why can't you do it?
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey? (Monkey)
With a monkey? (Monkey)

Oh I count to ten
But I don't know how and I don't know when
To open my eyes
If you kiss me again
Like you did just now, like you did just then (just do it again)

I've had the rest
Now it's time I had the best

Back, back (do it again)

I tried my best

Keep on askin' baby, maybe
I'll get what I'm askin' for

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always givin' into it
Do you love your monkey or do you love me?

612 - Sweet Child o' Mine:Guns N' Roses
[Instrumental Intro/Guitar Riff]

[Verse 1]
She's got a smile that it seems, to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then, when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

[Chorus]
Woah-woah-woah
Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet love of mine
[Post-Chorus Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
 [Chorus]
Woah-oh-woah
Sweet child of mine
Ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet love of mine
[Post-Chorus Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet child of mine, ooh, yeah-eh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Sweet love of mine

Where do we go?
Where do we go now?

Mm-huh, where do we go now?
Ah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-oh (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
Ooh, where do we go now? (Where do we go?)
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-oh, wow
Where do we go?
Oh-oh, where do we go now?
(Oh) Where do we go, oh-oh-oh-oh? (Oh, wow)
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Woah-oh, where do we go now?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Sweet child

613 - Don't Worry, Be Happy:Bobby McFerrin
[Verse 1]
Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

[Chorus]
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

[Verse 2]
Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry, be happy (Look at me, I'm happy)

[Chorus]
Don't worry, be happy
(Hey I'll give you my phone number, when you worry call me I'll make you happy!)
Don't worry, be happy
 [Verse 3]
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you worry your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

[Chorus]
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

[Bridge]
Now there is the song I wrote
I hope you learned it note for note, like good little children
Don't worry, be happy
Now listen to what I said, in your life expect some trouble
When you worry you make it double
But don't worry, be happy, be happy now

[Chorus]
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
(Don't worry, don't worry, don't do it, be happy
Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like this
Don't worry, it will soon pass whatever it is)
Don't worry, be happy
I'm not worried
I'm happy24

614 - Love Bites:Def Leppard
[Intro]
If you've got love in your sights
Watch out
Love bites

[Verse 1]
When you make love, do you look in the mirror?
Who do you think of, does he look like me?
Do you tell lies? And say that it's forever
Do you think twice, or just touch and see?
Ooh, babe
Oh, yeah
When you're alone, do you let go?
Are you wild and willing or is it just for show?
Ooh, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it
No

[Chorus]
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need
 [Verse 2]
When I'm with you, are you somewhere else?
Am I getting through or do you please yourself?
When you wake up, will you walk out?
It can't be love if you throw it about
Ooh, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
Oh

[Chorus]
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it
No
[Chorus]
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies...
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need

[Outro]
If you've got love in your sights
Watch out

Off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo

618 - Wild, Wild West:The Escape Club
Forty seven deadbeats living in the back street
North, east, west, south, all in the same house
Sitting in a back room, waiting for the big boom
I'm in a bedroom waiting for my baby

She's so mean but I don't care
I love her eyes and her wild, wild hair
Dance to the beat that we love best
Heading for the nineties
Living in the wild, wild west
The wild, wild west (Wild west)

Well, Mandy's in the backroom, handing out Valium

And turn to the left, turn to the right

 She's so mean but I don't care
I love her eyes and her wild, wild hair
Dance to the beat that we love best
Heading for the nineties
Living in the wild, wild west

'Cause some people them a-keep waitin' for
This one's called the outlaw, wow

Murder me chatter when me chat on the mic
Shorties thought this could keep them rockin' 'til the broad daylight
And here comes this Escape Club to rock, it's alright, say

Living in the wild, wild west

Give me love, give me love, give me time to live it up

Now put your flags in the air and march them up and down
You can live it up, live it up all over the town

[Chorus]
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad medicine)

[Verse 1]
I ain't got a fever got a permanent disease
It'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms count them, one, two, three

[Pre-Chorus]
First you need (That's what you get for falling in love)

I don't need no needle to be giving me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addiction, it doesn't leave a track
I've got a jones for your affection like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack

[Pre-Chorus]
When you need (That's what you get for falling in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little but it's never enough)
On your knees (That's what you get for falling in love)

Oh-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need

620 - Look Away:Chicago
[Verse 1: Bill Champlin]
When you called me up this morning
Told me about the new love you found
I said "I'm happy for you
I'm really happy for you"
Found someone else
I guess I won't be coming around
I guess it's over, baby
It's really over, baby, whoa...
And from what you saying
I know you've gotten over me
It'll never be the way it used to be
So if it's got to be this way
Don't worry, baby, I can take the news okay

[Chorus: Bill Champlin, with bandmates]
But if you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
If we meet on the streets someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

[Verse 2: Bill Champlin]
When we both agreed as lovers
We were better off as friends
That's how it had to be
Yeah, that's how it had to be
I tell you I'm fine
But sometimes I just pretend
Wish you were holding me
Wish you were still holding me, whoa...
I just never thought
That I would be replaced so soon
I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you
I know I wanted to be free
Yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be
 [Chorus: Bill Champlin, with bandmates]
But if you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
If we meet on the streets someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Bill Champlin, with bandmates]
If you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
If we meet on the streets someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me
If you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me
[Outro: Bill Champlin]
When you called me up this morning
Told me about the new love you found
I said "I'm happy for you
I'm really happy for you"2

621 - Every Rose Has Its Thorn:Poison
[Verse 1]
We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did?
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you, though I tried
But I guess that's why they say

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn, yeah, it does

[Verse 2]
I listen to our favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say, "Love's a game of easy come
And easy go"
But I wonder, does he know?
Has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow, I guess
 [Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

[Bridge]
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

[Verse 3]
I know I could have saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of making love
We both made our separate ways
And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife, I guess

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn17

[Verse 1]
They say I'm crazy, I really don't care

Well, there was no reason to believe she'd always be there
But if you don't put faith in what you believe in
It's getting you nowhere
Cause it hurts, you never let go
Don't look down, just look up
Cause she's always there behind you, just to remind you

[Chorus]
Two hearts, believing in just one mind
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind

[Verse 2]
Cause there's no easy way to, to understand it

And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you no matter how far
Wherever you are

Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind

Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh, oh, oh)

626 - Lost in Your Eyes:Debbie Gibson
[Verse 1]
I get lost in your eyes
And I feel my spirits rise
And soar like the wind
Is it love that I am in?

[Verse 2]
I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
And now I know
'Cause when I'm lost, I can let go

[Chorus]
I don't mind not knowing
What I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in Heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

[Verse 3]
I just fell, don't know why
Something's there we can't deny
And when I first knew
Was when I first looked at you

[Verse 4]
And if I can't find my way
If salvation seems worlds away
Ooh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes, woah-oh-oh
 [Chorus]
I don't mind not knowing
What I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in Heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

[Refrain]
I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
Ooh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes

[Outro]
Oh-oh1

627 - The Living Years:Mike + The Mechanics
[Verse 1]
Every generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door

I know that I'm a prisoner to all my father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage, to all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years

Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got

You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defence

[Chorus]
Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye
 [Verse 2]
So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts

So don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different day
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be okay

[Chorus]
Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye

[Verse 3]
I wasn't there that morning
When my father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say
I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him
In the living years

[Chorus]
Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye2

628 - The Look:Roxette
[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Walkin' like a man
Hitting like a hammer
She's a juvenile scam
Never was a quitter
Tasty like a raindrop
She's got the look

Heavenly bound
'Cause heaven's got her number
When she's spinnin' me around
Kissin' is a color
Her lovin' is a wild dog
She's got the look

[Chorus]
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
She's got the look

What in the world can make a
Brown-eyed girl turn blue?
When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la
She's got the look
 [Verse 2]
Fire in the ice
Naked to the T-bone
Is a lover's disguise
Bangin' on the head drum
Shakin' like a mad bull
She's got the look

Swayin' to the band
Movin' like a hammer
She's a miracle man
Lovin' is the ocean
And kissin' is the wet sand
She's got the look

[Chorus]
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
What in the world can make a
Brown-eyed girl turn blue?
When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la
She's got the look
Ow!

[Verse 1]

Can make you so blue?

I'll do for you

629 - She Drives Me Crazy:Fine Young Cannibals
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can't stop the way I feel
Things you do don't seem real
Tell me what you've got in mind
'Cause we're running out of time
Won't you ever set me free?
This waiting 'round's killing me

[Chorus]
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

I can't get any rest
People say I'm obsessed
Everything you say is lies
But to me, there's no surprise
What I had for you was true
Things go wrong, they always do

[Chorus]
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
 [Verse 3]
I won't make it on my own
No one likes to be alone

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy

Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself3

631 - I'll Be There for You:Bon Jovi
[Verse 1]
I guess this time you're really leavin'
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well as my broken heart lies bleedin'
You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimmin' for the shore
You left me drownin' in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I'm prayin' to God you'll give me one more chance, girl

[Chorus]
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you

[Verse 2]
I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hidin' place
Well, I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday
And, baby, you know my hands are dirty
(And baby you know my hands are dirty)
But I wanted to be your valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine
 [Chorus]
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And I wasn't there when you were happy
(And I wasn't there to make you happy)
I wasn't there when you were down
I didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out

[Chorus]
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you

Have you been hearin' the stories? They're goin' around

Forever your girl
Just remember
I'm forever your girl

634 - Wind Beneath My Wings:Bette Midler
[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind

[Verse 2]
So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

[Chorus]
Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

[Verse 2]
It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know, I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you
 [Chorus 2]
Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

[Bridge]
Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away, you let me fly so high
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings

[Outro]
Fly, fly, so high against the sky
So high I almost touch the sky
Thank you, thank you
Thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings3

[Intro]
Yeah

636 - Satisfied:Richard Marx
Yeah, yeah
Whoa

We work our bodies weary
To stay alive
There must be more to living
Than nine to five

Why should we wait for some better time?
There may not even be a tomorrow
Ain't no sense in losing your mind
I'm gonna make it worth the ride

Don't you know
I won't give up until I'm satisfied?
Don't you know
Why should I stop until I'm satisfied?

Ignore the hesitation
That ties your hands
Use your imagination
And take a chance

Won't let my moment of truth pass me by
I've gotta make my move, now or never
And if they turn me loose on this town
They're gonna have to hold me down
 Don't you know
I won't give up until I'm satisfied?
Don't you know
Why should I stop until I'm satisfied?
Yeah

Ain't gonna stop up until we're satisfied?

638 - Good Thing:Fine Young Cannibals
[Verse 1]
The one good thing in my life
Has gone away, I don't know why
She's gone away, I don't know where
Somewhere I cannot follow her

[Pre-Chorus]
The one good thing didn't stay too long
My back was turned and she was gone

[Chorus]
Good thing
Where have you gone? (Do, do-do-do)
My good thing

[Intro]
If you don't know me by now
You will never, never, never know me, uh-uh-uh

[Verse 1]
All the things, that we've been through
You should understand me like I understand you
Now girl I know the difference between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing to break up our happy home
Don't get so excited when I come home a little late at night
'Cause we only act like children when we argue, fuss and fight

[Chorus]
If you don't know me by now (If you don't know me)
You will never, never, never know me (No you won't), uh
If you don't know by now
You will never, never, never know me, uh-uh-uh

[Verse 2]
We've all got our own funny moods
I've got mine, woman, you've got yours too
Just trust in me like I trust in you
As long as we've been together it should be so easy to do
Just get yourself together or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair when we can't see eye to eye

If you don't know me by now (If you don't know me)
You will never, never, never know me (No you won't), uh-uh-uh

640 - Toy Soldiers:Martika
[Intro]
Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
It wasn't my intention to mislead you
It never should have been this way
What can I say?
It's true
I did extend the invitation
I never knew how long you'd stay
When you hear temptation call
It's your heart that takes
Takes the fall
(Won't you come out and play with me?)

[Chorus]
Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers
 Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
It's getting hard to wake up in the morning
My head is spinning constantly
How can it be?
How could I be so blind to this addiction?
If I don't stop
The next one's gonna be me
Only emptiness remains
It replaces all
All the pain
(Won't you come out and play with me?)

[Chorus]
Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers

Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers
(We never win)
[Bridge]
Only emptiness remains
It replaces all
All the pain
(Won't you come out and play with me?)

[Chorus]
Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers

Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Outro]
Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down (all fall down, all fall down)
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers2

Or know when to face the truth

I knew it from the start you would break my heart
But still I had to play this painful part
You wrapped me round your little bitty finger
With your magic smile

You kept me hangin' on a lover's cross awhile
You put your spell on me, took my breath away
But there was nothin' I could do to make you stay
I'm gonna miss you

All the love I feel for you
Nothing could make me change my point of view
Oh girl, I'm gonna miss you, baby

Givin' all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leavin'
Now I'm sittin' here wastin' my time
I just don't know what I should do

It's a tragedy for me to see the dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl, I'm gonna miss you

Like a honey bee, you took the best of me
Now I can't erase those memories
Like a fairy tale, you were so unreal
You left a scar that's so hard to heal
 When you had a taste of paradise
Back on Earth can feel as cold as ice
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
I miss you

Givin' all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leavin'

You and me in paradise

They said you were leavin', someone's swept your heart away

I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you when I built my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming, oh
Even now, it's more than I can take
 [Chorus]
Tell me, how am I supposed to live without you?
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on?
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Now, I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Oh, now that your dream has come true

[Chorus]
Tell me, how am I supposed to live without you?
Now that I've been lovin' you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on?
When all that I've been livin' for is gone8

654 - Opposites Attract:Paula Abdul & The Wild Pair
[Verse 1: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
Baby, it seems we never ever agree
You like the movies and I like TV
I take things serious and you take 'em light
I go to bed early and I party all night
Our friends are saying we ain't gonna last
'Cause I move slowly and baby, I'm fast
I like it quiet and I love to shout
But when we get together, it just all works out

I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract

Who'd-a thought we could be lovers?
She makes the bed and he steals the covers
She likes it neat and he makes a mess
I take it easy, baby, I get obsessed
She's got the money and he's always broke
I don't like cigarettes and I like to smoke
Things in common? There just ain't a one!
But when we get together, we have nothin' but fun
 [Chorus: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract

And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract

You and me proving everyone wrong
Don't think we'll ever get our differences patched
Don't really matter 'cause we're perfectly matched

[Chorus: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact

Opposites attract
We go together
We go together
Two steps forward, two steps back

659 - Nothing Compares 2 U:Sinead O'Connor
[Verse 1]
It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing, I said, nothing can take away these blues

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

[Verse 2]
It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me
He said, "Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do," but he's a fool

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
 [Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the backyard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

[Outro]
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you20

Must have been love
But it's over now

[Verse 1]

Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely
This air of silence
In the bedroom and all around (All around)
Touch me now
I close my eyes
And dream away

664 - She Ain't Worth It:Glenn Medeiros featuring Bobby Brown
[Intro: Bobby Brown]
Better make tracks
Fast on the double
The girl's jazzy
But she's nothing but trouble

[Verse 1: Glenn Medeiros]
You take her where she wants to go
And every day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind

But she just got an attitude
Leads you on
Then leaves you blue
Can't you see
She's really just a waste of time

One day
She'll treat you nice
Then she turn as cold as ice
But you think
Your love will win her in the end
Think again

[Chorus:]
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief
That she's been putting you through
Ooh
 She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me
I know
I know better than
Better than, better than
Bet, bet better than you

[Verse 2: Glenn Medeiros]
She gets you hot
Then leaves you cold
Keeps you waiting on the phone
Cause she knows
You'll always give her one more try

You're not the only boy in town
And she loves playing to the crowd
But tell me
Do you really like standing in line?

You give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends
She did it again
[Repeat Chorus:]

[Glenn Medeiros:]
I'd like to say she used to be my girl
But that would be a lie
(That would be a lie)

Cause there's no one
In this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied I know
Cause I tried

[Rap: Bobby Brown]
Jump in
One thing I hate
Is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
Cause I've tried to make you mine

For the last time
So take this here as a dis
And a goodbye

She ain't worth it
Even though she's on the high tip
She better get a grip
And get a grip quick
Fast in a hurry
Cause I won't buckle
The girl's jazzy
But she's nothing but trouble

[Bridge: Glenn Medeiros]
Give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends
She did it again

[Repeat Chorus 3x:]1

665 - Vision of Love:Mariah Carey
[Verse 1]
Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

[Chorus]
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

[Verse 2]
Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

[Chorus]
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me
 [Bridge]
I've realized the dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

[Verse 3]
You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

[Chorus]
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be18

666 - If Wishes Came True:Sweet Sensation
All alone
Silence fills my room
But in a memory
I hear you calling me
Close my eyes
And I'm there with you
Like it was yesterday
But then it fades away

Take me back
Turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain
(Warm September rain)
Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way again

If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone
Always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers
Not apart
If wishes came true
 Now you're gone
And I'm on my own
Feeling lost inside since you said goodbye
In my dreams
I still feel your touch
Lying next to me
Feeling ecstasy

Take me back
Turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain
(Warm September rain)
Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way again

If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone
Always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers
Not apart
If wishes came true

I love you madly
I need you badly
Give our love one more chance
If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone
Always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers
Not apart
If wishes came truem

667 - Blaze Of Glory:Jon Bon Jovi
[Verse 1]
I wake up in the morning and I raise my weary head
I've got an old coat for a pillow, and the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm goin', only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run, a six gun lover, a candle in the wind

[Verse 2]
When you're brought into this world, they say you're born in sin
Well, at least they gave me somethin', I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well, they tell me that I'm wanted, yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable, I'm what Cain was to Abel, Mr. Catch-Me-If-You-Can

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
And, Lord, I never drew first, but I drew first blood
I'm no one's son, call me young gun

[Verse 3]
You ask about my conscience and I offer you my soul
You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man, well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come, I've seen it shot down, I've seen it die in vain

[Chorus]
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son, call me young gun
 [Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Each night I go to bed, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No, I ain't lookin' for forgiveness, but before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I gotta ask a favor, and I'll hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest, let this boy die like a man
Starin' down a bullet, let me make my final stand

[Chorus]
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
And I'm no one's son, call me young gun
I'm a young gun
Young gun
Young gun1

668 - Release Me:Wilson Phillips
[Intro]
I know that it's time for a change
Mmm but when that change comes
Will it still feel the same?

[Verse 1]
How many times have I tried
To turn this love around?
I don't wanna give up but, baby
It's time I had two feet on the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you release me?
Can you release me?

[Verse 2]
Now that you're gone
I can't help myself from wondering
Ohh, if you'd have come down from your high
Would we've been all right?

[Pre-Chorus]
Release me
Can you release me?

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
But somehow it's just not that easy
Come on, darlin', hear me, darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby, you've just got to release me
Release me, release me
 [Verse 3]
I'm not going back to you anymore
Finally my weakened heart is healing
Though very slow
So stop coming around my door
'Cause you're not gonna find what you're looking for

[Chorus]
Ohh, come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
Somehow it's just not that easy
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Come on darlin', now, hear me darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby, you've just got to release me

[Bridge]
Now tell me
What is this power you've got on me?
What is this power? Ohh

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
But somehow it's just not that easy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, baby
Come on darlin', now, hear me darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby, you've just got to release me
[Outro]
Release me, release me
Release me, will you release me?
Ahh, release me
Release me, will you release me?

669 - (Can't Live Without Your) Love And Affection:Nelson
(Here she comes) Mmm, just like an angel
Seems like forever that she's been on my mind
But nothing has changed
She thinks I'm a waste of her time

(There she goes) she don't know what she's missing
Can't she see I'll never give up the fight
I'll do all I can
Till she understands my desire

I've been on the outside looking in
Let me into your heart, oh
There's nothing on earth that should keep us apart
Baby

I can't live without your love and affection
I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone
'Cause I can't live without your love
Mmm, your love

(So I wait) Here for an answer
And wonder if tomorrow will be like yesterday
I'll keep holding on
Can't go on living this way, baby
 I've been on the outside looking in
Bring my tears to an end, oh
I realize there's no use for me to pretend
Oh yeah

I can't live without your love and affection
I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone
'Cause I can't live without your love

(For your love) I'd put my arms around you
(For your love) I'd find the strength to tell you
(For your love) That I can't live without your

I can't live without your love and affection
I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone
Baby

I can't live without your love and affection
I just can't go on this way anymore
As hard as I try there's one thing that I know for sure
I can't live without your love

(There she goes)
I can't live without your love, baby
(There she goes)
Oh, I can't live without your love
(There she goes)
Oh, I can't live without your love1

670 - Close To You:Maxi Priest
[Verse 1]
She was a Jezebel
Miss Brixton queen
Living her life like a bad sweet dream
Telling me lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear

Spinning around
Like a wheel on fire
Walking the tightrope on love's highwire
A fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escaping me

[Chorus]
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

[Verse 2]
I feel love
When I'm lying in the midnight hour
Holding you's just like a dream
Love is never what it seems

When we touch
And you're holding me the way you feel
Girl, you make my dreams come true
You make my dreams come true
 [Chorus]
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

[Verse 3]
She was a Gemini on the cusp of Mars
She holds me back
But she goes too far
Winding me up just to let me down

So emotional
Gagged and bound
There's more to this than meets the eye

A devil woman locked inside
With the formal rising
I was scared
I think I was possesed

[Chorus]
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel
I feel love
Everytime your body's next to mine
Somethin' deep inside of me
Wants to love you endlessly

When we touch
Girl, you don't know
How it makes me feel
I just can't believe it's real
I can't believe it's real!

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

[Verse 4]
She had an attitude
I can't explain
You never know if your in flame
Tying me up with elastic words
I'm on a countdown till I get hurt

Her blood was hot
She burned so bright
A neon sign there in the night
It's hard to say if I went too far
My heart still bears a scar
[Chorus]
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
(She was a Jezebel
This bursting queen
Living her life like a bad sweet dream)

Telling me lies
When the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear

I just wanna be close to you
(Spinning around like a wheel on fire)
Walkin' the tightrope on love's highwire
A fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escaping me

I wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
(I just wanna be close to you, baby)
And show you the way I feel

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

671 - Praying for Time:George Michael
These are the days of the open hand, they will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance and legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor, and most of us are not sure
If we have too much, but we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way, he must have let us all out to play
Turned his back, and all God's children crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much, much too late
Well, maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand, oh, you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year
This is the year of the guilty man, your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say "What's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much, but I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score."
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
'Cause he has no children to come back for?
 It's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
So, maybe we should all be praying for time5

672 - I Don't Have the Heart:James Ingram
[Verse 1]
Your face is beaming
You say it's 'cause you're dreaming
Of how good it's going to be
You say you've been around
And now you've finally found
Everything you wanted and needed in me

[Chorus]
I don't have the heart
To hurt you
It's the last thing I wanna do
But I don't have the heart
To love you
Not the way you want me to

[Verse 2]
Inside I'm dying
To see you crying
How can I make you understand?
I care about you
So much about you, baby!
I'm trying to say this as gently as I can

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't have the heart
To hurt you
It's the last thing I wanna do
But I don't have the heart
To love you
Not the way you want me to
 [Bridge]
You're so trusting
And open
Hoping that love will start
But I don't have the heart
Oh, no!
I don't have the heart

[Chorus]
I don't have the heart
To hurt you
It's the last thing I wanna do
But I don't have the heart
To love you
Not the way that you want me to

[Outro]
I don't have the heart
Ooh!
Baby, I don't have the heart!
I don't have the heart
I don't have the heart
Ooh! Ooh!
Baby, I don't have the heart!
I don't have the heart
I don't have the heart
I don't have the heart
I don't have the heart

673 - Black Cat:Janet Jackson
[Verse 1]
All the lonely nights, I spend alone
Never around to love me, you're always gone
'Cause you're hanging out, breaking the rules
Oh, the man has come looking for you
You're a rebel now, don't give a damn
Always carrying on with the gang
I'm trying to tell you, boy, it's a mistake
You won't realize 'til it's too late

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

[Chorus]
Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Living on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die

[Verse 2]
You're so together, boy, but just at a glance
You'll do anything if given a chance
Scheming, planning lies to get what you need
So full of promises that you never keep
Don't you tell yourself that it's okay
Sick and tired of all of your games
And you want me to stay, ah, better change
Makes no sense to me, your crazy ways
 [Pre-Chorus]
Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

[Bridge]
Not afraid to die
Black cat, black cat
Man, I don't understand your ways
Living on the edge

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

[Chorus]
Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Living on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die
Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Living on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die
Black cat, living' on the
Heartbeat, better watch your step4

674 - Ice Ice Baby:Vanilla Ice
[Intro]
Yo VIP, let's kick it
[Chorus]
Ice, ice, baby
Ice, ice, baby

[Verse 1]
Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with the brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
"Will it ever stop?" Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights, huh, and I'll glow
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance, rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it, you better gangway
You better hit the bullseye, the kid don't play
And if there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
[Chorus]
Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
[Verse 2]
Now that the party is jumpin'
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point, no fakin'
Cookin' MCs like a pound of bacon
Burnin' 'em if you're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With the ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby, wavin' just to say hi
"Did you stop?" No, I just drove by
Kept on, pursuin' to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm headin' to the next stop
The block was dead, yo, so I continued to
A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous, 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a 9
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots raged out like a bell
I grabbed my 9, all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene, you know what I mean?
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
[Chorus]
Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Ice, ice, baby

[Verse 3]
Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this.  Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say, "Damn!"
If rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
[Chorus]
Ice ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Ice ice, baby
Vanilla Ice
[Outro]
Yo man, let's get out of here
Word to your mother
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)
Ice

675 - Love Takes Time:Mariah Carey
[Verse 1]
I had it all
But I let it slip away
Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone

[Chorus]
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

[Verse 2]
Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete
Lord I'm need you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly
 [Chorus]
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

[Bridge]
You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do and I feel that you do
Inside

[Chorus]
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was so blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be there alone8

So I decided to write you this song
And just to let you know exactly the way I feel

[Verse 1]
Our friends think we're opposites
Falling in and out of love
They've all said we'd never last
Still we manage to stay together

[Verse 2]
There's no easy explanation for it
But whenever there's a problem
We always work it out somehow
Work it out somehow

680 - The First Time:Surface
[Verse 1]
You know I won't forget the times
We shared together holding hands
And walking in the park
Sometimes we'll have to do it all again
We were so happy then
I have no regrets

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you tell from the look on my face
That I love you more today

[Chorus]
The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love
You looked into my eyes, wiped the tears away
The first time when we fell in love

[Verse 2]
Although some time has passed
I still remember just like it was yesterday
The time is moving fast
The love I have for you time won't ever change
I'll always feel the same now until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Memories we share will live forever
Deep inside my heart I know I'll never forget

The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love
You looked into my eyes, wiped the tears away
The first time when we fell in love

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love
You looked into my eyes, wiped the tears away
The first time when we fell in love

[Outro]
Oh, when we fell in love

Tryna get a nut to move your butt
To the dance floor, so yo what's up
Hands in the air, come on, say "Yeah"

682 - All the Man That I Need:Whitney Houston
[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I used to cry myself to sleep at night
But that was all before he came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now he's here
It's not the same, it's not the same

[Chorus]
He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

[Verse 2]
And in the morning when I kiss his eyes
He takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
He holds me close and won't let go
He won't let go
 [Chorus]
He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
He fills me up (He fills me up)
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen (More love than I've ever seen)
He's all I've got (He's all I've got)
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need (All the man, all the man I need)
He fills me up (He fills me up)
He gives me love
More, more love, more love, more love, more love (More love than I've ever seen)
He's all I've got (He's all I've got)
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man, all the man (All the man, all the man I need)

683 - Someday:Mariah Carey
[Verse 1]
You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself "I just don't need her now"
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other

[Chorus]
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause, baby, I'm the one who's keeping score

[Verse 2]
You'll change your mind and call my name
As soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying, you shoulda have known
Believe me, I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
Because I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others
 [Chorus]
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

[Bridge]
Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me, the one and only?
But when your down in your time in need
And you're thinking how you might be coming back to own me
Just think again because I won't need your love anymore

[Chorus]
Someday
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, someday
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, someday
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score6

684 - One More Try:Timmy T
It's been a long time since you left me
I didn't mean to make you cry
I didn't mean to disappiont you
I didn't mean to tell you lies

And after all that we have been through
Won't you let me tell you why

One more try
I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try
Let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby, can we give it one more try

It's been a long time since I've kissed you
It always used to feel so good
And if you knew how much I missed you
You'd forgive me if you could

And now that we have found each other
Can't we give it one more try

One more try
I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try
Let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby, can we give it one more try
 And after all that we have been through
Won't you let me tell you why
And now that we have found each other
Can't we give it one more try

One more try
I didn't know how much I loved you
One more try
Let me put my arms around you
Living all these lonely nights without you
Oh baby, can we give it one more try

Oh girl, you know I love you
I just want you to know
Our love, I'll always treasure
So please, just don't let me go1

685 - Coming Out of the Dark:Gloria Estefan
[Verse 1]
Why be afraid if I'm not alone?
Though life is never easy, the rest is unknown
And up to now for me, it's been hands against stone
Spent each and every moment searching for what to believe

Coming out of the dark
I finally see the light now
And it's shining on me
Coming out of the dark
I know the love that saved me
You're sharing with me

And I'll be so much stronger holding your hand
Step by step, I'll make it through, I know I can
It may not make it easier, but I have felt you
Near all the way

Coming out of the dark
I finally see the light now

To know where my lucky love belongs, whoa no

Cause it all begins again when it ends, yeah
And we're all magic friends (magic friends, magic friends)

You're such a good time (yes, it is)

691 - I Don't Wanna Cry:Mariah Carey
[Verse 1]
Once again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby, look what we've become
We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain

[Chorus]
I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry

[Verse 2]
Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone
Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around
 [Chorus]
I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry, no no

[Bridge]
All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make-believing
On make-believing

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
Said I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
[Outro]
Cry...
I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna...
Cry...7

693 - Unbelievable:EMF
(Oh!)
(What the)
(What the, was that?)

[Verse 1]
You burden me with your questions
You'd have me tell no lies
You're always asking what it's all about
But don't listen to my replies
You say to me I don't talk enough
But when I do I'm a fool
These times I've spent, I've realized
I'm going to shoot through

Is more than I ever know
But this time, I realize
I'm going to shoot through
And leave you
 [Chorus]
The things, you say
Your purple prose just give you away
The things, you say
You're Unbelievable
(Woah! What the, was that?)

Seemingly lastless, don't mean
You can ask us
Pushing down the relative
Bringing out your higher self
Think of the fine times, pushing
Down the better few, instead of
Bringing out the clues, to what the
World and everything anger to, brace
Yourself with the grace of ease
I know this world ain't what it seems
(What the, was that?)
It's unbelievable

[Verse 1]
You burden me with your questions
You'd have me tell no lies
You're always asking what it's all about
But don't listen to my replies

But when I do I'm a fool
These times I've spent, I've realized
I'm going to shoot through
And leave you

Your purple prose just gives you away
The things, you say
Before I love you more

701 - When A Man Loves A Woman:Michael Bolton
When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world
For the good thing he's found

If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on
To what he needs

He'd give up all his comforts
Sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It oughta be, hey

When a man loves a woman, hey
I give you everything I've got
Trying to hold on to your precious love
Baby, baby please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him
Such misery
 If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes
Can never see

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
Cause, baby, baby

When a man loves a woman, oh
When a man loves a woman, yeah
When a man loves a woman
When a man, when a man, when a man loves a woman

702 - Set Adrift on Memory Bliss:P.M. Dawn
[Hook]
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

[Verse 1]
The camera pans the cocktail glass
Behind a blind of plastic plants
I found the lady with the fat diamond ring
Then you know I can't remember a damn thing
I think it's one of those deja vu things
Or a dream that's tryin' to tell me somethin'
Or will I ever stop thinkin' about it
I don't know, I doubt it
Subterranean by design
I wonder what I would find
If I met you, let my eyes caress you
Until I meet the thought of Mrs Princess Who?
I often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone; solitaire
I can remember when
I caught up with a past-time intimate friend
She said, bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me
She was right, though, I can't lie
She's just one of those corners in my mind
And I just put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess
 [Hook]
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

[Verse 2]
A careless whisper from a careless man
A neutron dance for a neutron fan
Marionette strings are dangerous things
I thought of all the trouble they bring
An eye for an eye, a spy for spy
Rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh
Tell me that she's not dreaming
She's got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning
Reality used to be a friend of mine
Cause complete control, I don't take too kind
Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on
But guess whose piece of the cake was jacked on?
She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign
I told her whispers in my heart were fine
What did she think she could do?
I feel for her, I really do
And I stared at the ring finger on her hand
I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan
But I had to put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess
[Hook]
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell 'em
I ain't second to none

It don't matter if you're Black or White, ooh!
 [Break: Michael Jackson]
Gone withca girl!
Hee-hee!

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
I am tired of this devil

Oh, when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

[Verse 3: L.T.B.]
Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye, hee-hee!
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're Black or White
[Post-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're Black or White
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're Black or White

[Outro: Michael Jackson]
Alright, alright

Alright, alright (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

It's tough for you to be that (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo!39

I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

[Verse 2: George Michael]
It's much too late to save myself from fallin'
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

[Chorus: George Michael]
Don't let the sun go down on me, yeah
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, oh
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

[Verse 3: Elton John, George Michael, & both]
I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me (Baby, no)
Just because you think I mean you harm
(Just because you think I mean you harm, no)
But these cuts I have (Cuts I have)
They need love (They need love, they need love)
To help them heal, oh
 [Chorus: Elton John, George Michael, & both]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, oh
'Cause losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

Don't let the sun go down on me

[Verse 1]
Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise

Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

[Chorus]
And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

[Verse 2]
All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you
Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see
 [Chorus]
But now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

Sometimes the very thing
You're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon

709 - Baby Got Back:Sir Mix-A-Lot
[Intro: Girls]
"Oh, my, god, Becky, look at her butt. It is so big. She looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends. Who understands those rap guys? They only talk to her, because she looks like a total prostitute, okay? I mean, her butt, it's just so big. Ugh, I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there, I mean, ugh, gross. Look! She's just so black!"
[Verse 1: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face, you get sprung
Wanna pull up tough 'cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearin'
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin'
Oh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes (Me so horny!)
Oh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen 'em dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She sweat, wet
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah!)
Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!)
Shake that healthy butt!
Baby got back!
 [Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)
Baby got back!
(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)
(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)

[Verse 2: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh-ugh
I ain't talkin' 'bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sisters, I wanna get wit'cha
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna
'Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! (Yeah!) Ladies! (Yeah)
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes (Yeah!)
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout
[Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
Baby got back!
Baby got back!

[Bridge: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
"Yeah, baby. When it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection. 36-24-36? Ha-ha, only if she's 5'3"."

[Verse 3: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game, but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throwdown
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!
[Outro]
Baby got back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!

710 - This Used To Be My Playground:Madonna
[Chorus]
This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say

[Verse 1]
Don't look back, keep your head held high, don't ask them why
Because life is short, and before you know, you're feeling old
And your heart is breaking, don't hold on to the past
Well, that's too much to ask

[Chorus]
This used to be my playground (Used to be)
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say

[Verse 2]
No regrets, but I wish that you were here with me
Well, then there's hope yet, I can see your face In our secret place
You're not just a memory, say goodbye to yesterday
Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say)
 [Chorus]
This used to be my playground (Used to be)
This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy
This used to be our playground (Used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
I wish you were standing here with me
This used to be our playground (Used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
The best things in life are always free
Wishing you were here with me1

711 - End of the Road:Boyz II Men
[Intro: Michael McCary]
Girl, you know we belong together
I have no time for you to be playin' with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever, baby, you just see

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart
Why do you play with my mind?
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye?

[Pre-Chorus: Wany Morris]
When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try, I just break down and cry
Pain in my head, oh, I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still, I can't let go

 [Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
Girl, I know you really love me

Maybe I'll forgive you, mmm
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I

[Pre-Chorus: Wany Morris]

Come to the end of the road (I don't know what I'm gonna do 'cause I know I've come to the end of the road, the end of the road)
Still, I can't let go (Oh my God, oh my God, help me out a little bit, baby)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

[Interlude: Michael McCary, Shawn Stockman]
Girl, I'm here for you
All those times at night when you just hurt me
And just ran out with that other fella
Baby, I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you, do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat all night (Maybe I'll forgive you, baby)
Just like you did, baby, but that's alright
Heh, I love you anyway (Maybe you'll try)
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'til my dying day, baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain, baby (We should be happy together forever)
'Cause you just won't come back to me (You and I)
Will you? Just come back to me (Yeah, yeah)

I hear her voice
In my mind
I know her face by heart
Heaven and earth are moving in my soul
And I dont know where to start
Tell me tell me the words to define
The way I feel about someone so fine

How do you talk to an angel?
How do you hold her close to where you are?
How do you talk to an angel?
It's like tryin' to catch a falling star

At night I dream and she is there
And I can feel her in the air
Tell me tell me the words to define
The way I feel about someone so fine

How do you talk to an angel?
How do you hold her close to where you are?
How do you talk to an angel?
It's like tryin' to catch a falling star

How do you hold her close to where you are?

 How do you talk to an angel?
How do you hold her close to where you are?
How do you talk to an angel?
It's like tryin' to catch a falling star1

Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

On a magic carpet ride

Or say we're only dreaming

A dazzling place I never knew
But now from way up here, it's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A hundred thousand things to see
Hold your breath, it gets better

With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare

718 - Weak:SWV
[Verse 1]
I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
It's a feeling that I want to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

[Chorus]
I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)
I lose all control and something takes over me (Control, takes over me)
In a daze and it's so amazing (Amaze)
It's not a phase (It's not), I want you to stay with me (Stay with me)
By my side, I swallow my pride (My pride)
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

[Verse 2]
Time after time, after time I try to fight it
But your love is strong, it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down when you're around, cries fading
In my condition, I don't want to be alone
 [Pre-Chorus]
'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you, ohh

[Chorus]
I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)
I lose all control and something takes over me (Control, takes over me)
In a daze and it's so amazing (Amaze)
It's not a phase (It's not), I want you to stay with me (Stay with me)
By my side, I swallow my pride (My pride)
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

[Bridge]
I try hard to fight it
No way can I deny it
Your love's so sweet
Knocks me off my feet

[Chorus]
I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)
I lose all control and something takes over me (Control, takes over me)
In a daze and it's so amazing (Amaze)
It's not a phase (It's not), I want you to stay with me (Stay with me)
By my side, I swallow my pride (My pride)
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak
[Verse 3]
(I get so weak)
Blood starts racing through my veins

Boy, it's something I can't explain
(I get so weak)
Something 'bout the way you do
The things you do, it
(Knocks me right off of my feet)
Ohh, off my feet, I
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

[Chorus]
I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)
I lose all control and something takes over me (Control, takes over me)
In a daze and it's so amazing (Amazing)
It's not a phase (It's not), I want you to stay with me (I want you to stay)
By my side, I swallow my pride (My pride)
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet (Ohh, I)
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak46

721 - I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That):Meat Loaf
[Chorus]
And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact
But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
Oh no, no way
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Verse 1]
And some days it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end
And some nights you're breathing fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever
Seen before, or will again

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm crazy
Oh, it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true
You better believe it
 [Chorus]
That I would do anything for love
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way
Tonight
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Post-Chorus]
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

[Verse 2]
And some days I pray for silence
And some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the God
Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll
And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls
[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long, so long
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No no no, I won't do that

[Post-Chorus]
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do
[Chorus]
But I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life
No way
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Spoken: Lorraine Crosby & Meat Loaf]
Will you raise me up?
Will you help me down?
Will you help get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?
I can do that
Oh, I can do that
Will you hold me sacred
Will you hold me tight
Will you colorize my life
I'm so sick of black and white
Can you make it all a little less old?
I can do that
Oh no now, I can do that
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?
Now, I can do that
Ooh now, I can do that
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?
Now, I can do that
Oh now, I can do that
After a while you'll forget everything
As a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
Then you'll see that it's time to move on
I won't do that
I won't do that
I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later, you'll be screwing around
I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Outro]
Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that9

722 - Again:Janet Jackson
[Verse 1]
I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me in my
Mind

[Chorus]
"How can I be strong?" I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

[Verse 2]
A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions, you had many
I know you did
I've come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

[Pre-Chorus]
Making love to you
Ooh, it felt so good and
Ooh, so right
 [Chorus]
"How can I be strong?" I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

[Verse 3]
So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss
I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
I don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

[Bridge]
Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love me then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with
You again

[Outro]
Hold me
Hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do
Love you

723 - Hero:Mariah Carey
[Verse 1]
There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

[Chorus]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

[Verse 2]
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear
 [Chorus]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

[Bridge]
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

[Chorus]
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
[Outro]
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you

When honor's at stake
This vow I will make, yeah

We got everything and more than we had planned
More than the rivers that run the land
We've got it all in our hands

Now it's all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need

And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

And you are my man

Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
When the world outside's too

It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

Made it clear
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'm gonna do all that I can

729 - Stay (I Missed You):Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories
You say I only hear what I want to
You say I talk so all the time, so?
And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong 'cause I missed you
Yeah, yeah, I missed you

And you say I only hear what I want to
I don't listen hard, don't pay attention
To the distance that you're running, to anyone, anywhere
I don't understand if you really care
I'm only hearing negative, no, no, no (Bad)

And so I, I turn the radio on, I turn the radio up (Turn the radio up)
And this woman was singing my song
Lovers in love and the other's run away
Lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay

Some of us hover and we weep for the other
Who was dying since the day they were born
Well, well, this is not that
I think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown

And I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever
That won't take me anyhow or anywhere with you
 You said that I was naive
And I thought that I was strong, oh
I thought, "Hey, I can leave, I can leave"
Oh, but now I know that I was wrong 'cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you
You said you caught me 'cause you want me
And one day you'd let me go
You try to give away a keeper
But keep me 'cause you know you're just so scared to lose
And you say, "Stay"

And you say I only hear what I want to6

Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
And if you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?

I'm down on bended knee

Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?

Say I'm sorry

It'll heal all things
It won't hurt anymore
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees begging you please
Come home

734 - Take A Bow:Madonna
[Verse 1: Madonna & Babyface]
Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low, the curtains down
There's no one here
(There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd)
Say your lines, but do you feel them?
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around?
(No one around)
Watching you, watching me, one lonely star
(One lonely star, you don't know who you are)

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye (Bye-bye)
Say good-bye

[Verse 2: Madonna & Babyface]
Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part where you're breaking my heart
(Breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
(Just make them smile the whole world loves a clown)
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
(Role that you played)
No more masquerade, you're one lonely star
(One lonely star and you don't know who you are)
 [Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)

Say good-bye (Bye-bye)
Say good-bye

[Bridge: Madonna & Babyface]
All the world is a stage (World is a stage)

You'd break my heart?

735 - This Is How We Do It:Montell Jordan
[Intro]
(Background chatter)
This is how we do it!
(This is how we do it!)
Sha la la la la la lo
Shabada lo lo lo, whoa
(This is how we do it!)
Lo lo lo low-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
This is how we do it
It's Friday night, and I feel alright
The party is here on the West Side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver, take the keys to my truck
Hit the 'shaw cause I'm faded
Honies in the street say, "Monty, yo, we made it!"
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gangbangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid

[Pre-Chorus]
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say
 [Chorus]
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (this is how we do it)

[Verse 2]
This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wannabe player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case g
But now I'm a big G
The girls see I got the money
Hundred-dollar bills, y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway

[Pre-Chorus]
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say...

[Chorus]
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
Y?N-Vee, SCC (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)
[Verse 3]
Check it out!
Once upon a time in '94
Montell made no money and life sure was slow
All they said was 6' 8" he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good
There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty, this is what he said
You and Oji are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we're makin' tha dash

[Chorus]
Ohh, I'm buzzin' because... (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)

[Outro]
Oh, it's party time! (This is how we do it)
Straight up comin' from the West Side (This is how we do it)
OG's got the flavor, yeah (This is how we do it)
And Monty does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
C'mon now, Def Jam, you know what it is (This is how we do it)
[Spoken Interlude]
Yo Montell, this Percy, man
The barber, your barber
Man I'm sitting up here listening to ya tape, dude
And this shit is on, man
You gon' make it, fool
Keep on doing what you doing, man

Nine oh nine, zero, eighty-
Gimme a call, man
We getting ready to step out to the Fox Hills Mall right now
But, uh
It's Monday morning, about a quarter to eleven, peace18

736 - Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman:Bryan Adams
[Verse 1]
To really love a woman
To understand her - You gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought - See every dream
And give her wings when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

[Verse 2]
To really love a woman - Let her hold you
'Til you know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her - really taste her
'Til you can feel her in your blood
And when you can see your unborn children in her eyes
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that you'll always be together
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?
 [Bridge]
Oh - You got to give her some faith - Hold her tight
A little tenderness - gotta treat her right
She will be there for you, takin' good care of you
You really gotta love your woman

Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

[Outro]
Yeah, just tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?
Oh, just tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?2

There used to be a greying tower alone on the sea
And you became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill

But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?

A light hits the gloom on the grey

738 - You Are Not Alone:Michael Jackson
[Verse 1]
Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be that you're not here with me?
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day, I sit and ask myself "How did love slip away?"
Somethin' whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Post-Chorus]
'Lone, 'lone
Why? 'Lone

[Verse 2]
Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens, I will bear
But first, I need your hand, then forever can begin
 [Pre-Chorus]
Every day, I sit and ask myself "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Whisper three words and I'll come runnin', fly
And girl, you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

[Chorus]
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you (Ooh)
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
That you are not alone (You are not alone)
I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (Though you're far away, you and me)

You and me, not alone, oh
('Lone, 'lone) Together, together
('Lone, 'lone) Not, not being alone
Not, not being alone
You believe in me34

739 - Gangsta's Paradise:Coolio featuring L.V.
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Look at the situation they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin', got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now but will I live to see 24?
The way things is going I don't know
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

All I wanted to say

Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together

And I know eventually we'll be together (Yes, we will)

743 - Because You Loved Me:Cline Dion
[Verse 1]
For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I would be forever thankful, baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through, through it all

[Chorus]
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

[Verse 2]
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand, I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you
 [Chorus]
You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

[Bridge]
You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark, shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies, you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

[Chorus]
You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak (When I couldn't speak)
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak (My voice)
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
Oh

I'm everything I am
Because you loved me17

I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt, uh
Play on, playette
Play on, playette
Yo, Dre, drop the verse

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me **** out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers
[Verse 2: Teddy Riley]
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (Wow)
I think about the girl all the time (Wow-wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?
 [Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey "Black" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)

No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Get up)

[Verse 3: Chauncey "Black" Hannibal]
She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild
Very low-key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers, it curves, so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You've got to pay to play
Just for shorty bang-bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride
[Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey "Black" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)

[Verse 4: Queen Pen]
'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a **** thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We bes the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-**** broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been diggin' you so
Please excuse if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how a playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your **** Chauncy
I'll be sending the call, let's say, around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity (No diggity, no doubt, baby)
[Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey "Black" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Girl, you got it going on)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Play on, play on, play on)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it

Sometimes your words just hypnotize me (Hypnotize)
And I just love your flashy ways (Uh-huh)
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid (Ha)
 [Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I put hoes in NY onto DKNY (Uh-huh)
Miami, D.C. prefer Versace (That's right)
All Philly hoes go with Moschino (Come on)
Every cutie with a booty bought a Coogi
Now who's the real dookie? Meaning, who's really the shit?
Them niggas ride dicks, Frank White push the six
Or the Lexus, LX, four and a half
Bulletproof glass, tints if I want some ass
Gonna blast, squeeze first, ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rappin' about blunts and broads
Tits and bras, menage a trois, sex in expensive cars
I'll still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment (Uh-uh)
At my arraignment, note for the plaintiff
"Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement"
Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy (Not Guilty)
Richer than Richie, 'til you niggas come and get me (Come on)

[Chorus: Pamela Long]
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see? (Uh-huh)
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me (Hypnotize)
And I just love your flashy ways (Uh-huh)
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid
[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I can fill you with real millionaire shit (I can fill ya)
Escargot, my car go one-sixty, swiftly (Come on)
Wreck it, buy a new one
Your crew run-run-run, your crew run-run
I know you sick of this, name brand nigga with
Flows, girls say he's sweet like licorice
So, get with this nigga, it's easy (Uh-huh)
Girlfriend, here's a pen, call me round ten
Come through, have sex on rugs that's Persian (That's right)
Come up to your job, hit you while you workin'
For certain, Poppa freakin', not speakin'
Leave that ass leakin', like rapper demo
Tell them ho take they clothes off slowly (Slowly)
Hit 'em with the force like Obi (Obi)
Dick black like Toby (Toby)
Watch me roam like Romey (Romey)
Lucky they don't owe me
Where the safe? Show me, homie (Say what, homie)

[Chorus: Pamela Long]
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see? (Uh-huh)
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me (Hypnotize)
And I just love your flashy ways (Uh-huh)

You have so many relationships in this life
Only one or two will last
You go through all the pain and strife
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast
Oh yeah
And they're gone so fast, yeah

In the end they'll be the only ones there
And when you get old and start losing your hair
Can you tell me who will still care?

753 - I'll Be Missing You:Puff Daddy & Faith Evans featuring 112
[Interlude: Puff Daddy]
Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's just hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
I would do anything, man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit up, this shit don't mean nothing
I saw your son today, he look just like you
You was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
I miss you, B.I.G.
Can't wait 'til that day when I see your face again
I can't wait 'til that day when I see your face again

[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Yeah, this right here (Tell me why)
Goes out to everyone that has lost someone
That they truly loved (C'mon, check it out)

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
It seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death
 [Chorus: Faith Evans & Puff Daddy]
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you
Thinkin' of the day
When you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you (I miss you, B.I.G.)

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
It's kinda hard with you not around (Yeah)
Know you in Heaven, smilin' down (Ha)
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts, B.I.G., I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death
[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Every step I take
Every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day
When you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you (Somebody tell me why)

[Interlude: Faith Evans]
One glad morning
When this life is over
I know I'll see your face

[Outro: 112, Puff Daddy & Faith Evans]
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray, every step I take (Every day that passes is a day that I get closer)
Every move I make, every single day (To seeing you again)
Every night I pray, every step I take (We miss you, B.I.G., and we won't stop 'cause we can't stop)
Every move I make, every single day (That's right)
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day (We miss you, B.I.G)
Every step I take50

754 - Mo Money Mo Problems:The Notorious B.I.G. featuring Puff Daddy & Mase
[Produced by Stevie J, Diddy, Nashiem Myrick and 6 July]

[Verse 1: Ma$e]
Now, who's hot, who not?
Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores?
You tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop?
Whose jewels got rocks?
Who's mostly Dolce down to the tube sock?
The same old pimp, Mase
You know ain't nothing change but my limp
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee a million sales, call it love or luck
You don't believe in Harlem World, nigga, double up
We don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down
Niggas didn't know me '91, bet they know me now
I'm the young Harlem nigga with the Goldie sound
Can't no Ph.D. niggas hold me down
Cudda schooled me to the game, now I know my duty
Stay humble, stay low, blow like Hootie
True pimp niggas spend no dough on the booty
And then you yell, "There go Mase!", there go your cutie

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
 [Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
I'm the D to the A to the D-D-Y
Know you'd rather see me die than to see me fly
I call all the shots, rip all the spots
Rock all the rocks, cop all the drops
I know you thinking now, "When all the ballin' stops?"
Nigga never home, gotta call me on the yacht
Ten years from now we'll still be on top
Yo, I thought I told you that we won't stop
Now what you gon' do with a crew
That got money much longer than yours
And a team much stronger than yours?
Violate me, this'll be your day, we don't play
Mess around, be D.O.A., be on your way
'Cause it ain't enough time here
Ain't enough lime here for you to shine here
Deal with many women but treat dimes fair
And I'm bigger than the city lights down in Times Square
Yea, yea, yea

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
B-I-G P-O-P-P-A
No info for the DEA
Federal agents mad 'cause I'm flagrant
Tap my cell and the phone in the basement
My team supreme, stay clean
Triple beam lyrical dream, I be that
Cat you see at all events bent
Gats in holsters, girls on shoulders
Playboy, I told ya, mere mics to me
Bruise too much, I lose too much
Step on stage, the girls boo too much
I guess it's 'cause you run with lame dudes too much
Me lose my touch? Never that!
If I did, ain't no problem to get the gat
Where the true players at? Throw your Rolies in the sky
Wave 'em side to side and keep your hands high
While I give your girl the eye, player, please
Lyrically, niggas see B.I.G be flossin'
Jig on the cover of Fortune, 5-double-O
Here's my phone number, your man ain't got to know
I got the dough, got the flow down pizat
Platinum plus like thizat
Dangerous on trizacks, leave your ass flizat

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
[Break: Kelly Price]
What's going on? (What's going on?)
Somebody tell me (What's going on?)

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see

756 - 4 Seasons of Loneliness:Boyz II Men
[Verse 1: Wany Morris & Nathan Morris]
I long for
The warmth of
Days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty
Without you
By my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman]
When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same, oh)
 [Verse 2: Nathan Morris & (Michael McCary)]
Remember
The nights when (Remember the night)
We closed our eyes (When we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I
Would be in love for all time

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman]
Every time I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
[Bridge: Wany Morris & (Michael McCary)]
This loneliness has crushed my heart (It's killing me, baby)
Please let me love again (I just wanna know if I can fix this)

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman]
'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same)

Remember
The warmth of
Days gone by

Bag with a lot-a, stuff in it (Ugh, ugh, ugh)

Mama (Ugh) mama (Ugh) mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, uh
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad 'cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty-yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bought my hits and watch them go off, a-go off
Ah, yes-yes y'all (Woo), ya don't stop

[Verse 3]
Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from South Street to one-two-fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
C.R.E.A.M. to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill, but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me?
Don't be silly

Nah, ooh, mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm

[Verse 1]
I am thinkin' of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then, my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you and I won't pull through
Without you by my side

[Chorus]
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

[Verse 2]
Baby, can you feel me?
Imaginin' I'm lookin' in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet, you're so far, like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on

[Spoken Prelude: Brandy & Monica]
- Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?
- Uh-huh, sure. You know, you look kinda familiar
- Yeah, you do too. But um, I just wanted to know, do you know somebody named...? You, you know his name
- Oh yeah, definitely. I know his name
- Well, I just wanna let you know that he's mine
- Ha, no, no, he's mine!

[Chorus: Brandy]
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

[Verse 1: Brandy & Monica]
I think it's time we got this straight
Let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?
You see, I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me
You see, I tried to hesitate
I didn't wanna say what he told me
He said without me, he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame?
But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took (The boy is mine)
 [Chorus: Brandy (& Monica)]
You need to give it up
Had about enough (Enough)
It's not hard to see (Oh)
The boy is mine (Boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (Sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (Confused)
He belongs to me (Oh)
The boy is mine

[Verse 2: Monica & Brandy]
Must you do the things you do?
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me, not you
And if you didn't know it, girl, it's true
I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside
You can say what you wanna say
What we have, you can't take
From the truth, you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake
When will you get the picture?
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away, it's my time to shine
If you didn't know, the boy is mine, oh (The boy is mine, oh-oh)
[Chorus: Brandy]
You need to give it up
Had about enough (Enough)
It's not hard to see (To see)
The boy is mine (The boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (Sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (Seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (He belongs to me)
The boy is mine (The boy is mine)

I'm sorry that you (I'm so sorry)
Seem to be confused (You seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (He belongs to me)
The boy is mine

[Bridge: Monica & Brandy]
I can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games, I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel
What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart?
He was my love right from the start (The boy is mine)
[Chorus: Brandy, (Brandy & Monica)]
You need to give it up (Give it on up)
Had about enough (Had about enough)
It's not hard to see (It's not hard to see)

I'm sorry that you (I'm sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (Seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (He belongs to me)
The boy is mine (No, no)
You need to give it up (You need to give it up)
Had about enough (About enough)
It's not hard to see (It's not hard to see)
The boy is mine (The boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (Mine, oh)
Seem to be confused (Seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (He belongs to me)
The boy is mine (The boy is mine)

[Outro: Brandy, (Brandy & Monica)]
You need to give it up (Not yours)
Had about enough (But mine, not yours)
It's not hard to see (But mine, not yours)

765 - I Don't Want to Miss a Thing:Aerosmith
[Verse 1]
I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

[Chorus]
Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep

And I don't wanna miss a thing

[Verse 2]
Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating

In this moment forever
Forever and ever
 [Chorus]
I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep

Huh? Huh?
Baby, baby, tell me what's up?

Huh? Huh? What?

[Verse 1: Monica]
Boy, this evening, was it only me?
Feeling completely down to be open
Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't wanna say yes, afraid of your reaction
I knew it was wrong for feelin' this way
Especially the thought of gettin' in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night, I had to decide
I was thinkin'
 [Chorus: Monica]
I should make a move but I won't (I should, I should)
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowin' if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move, but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowin' if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night

[Verse 2: Monica]
We were chillin', watching your TV
I thought you was coming close as you got to me
Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
And somehow, in one night, discover I love you
Felt so right, but it felt so wrong
And look how we are carryin' on
Tryin' to say things to get me to stay
But my watch tells me it's gettin' too late
I'm thinkin'

[Chorus: Monica]
I should make a move, but I won't (I should, I should)
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong (No way)
Knowin' if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night (I don't, I don't get down, baby)
I should make a move, but I won't
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong
(You're probably thinkin' something is wrong)
Knowin' if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night
[Post-Chorus: Monica]
(If) If you want me
You got to know me (You got to know me)
And if you want my love (My love)
You gotta win my love

[Bridge: Monica]
Hey, baby
That's the way it's got to be, yeah
Get to know me (Get to know me)
So we can do this

[Chorus: Monica]
I should make a move
I know you're probably thinkin' (I won't, I won't, babe)
Knowin' if I do (I won't, I won't, baby, yeah, yeah)
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move, but I won't (No, no, no)
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong (No, no, no)
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night
I should make a move, but I won't (I should make a move)
I know you're probably thinkin' something is wrong
(Probably thinkin' something's wrong)
Knowing if I do that it won't be right (No, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't get down on the first night (The first night)
I should make a move, but I won't (I should, baby)

767 - One Week:Barenaked Ladies
[Chorus 1: Steven Page]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, "I'm angry"
Five days since you laughed at me, saying
"Get back together, come back and see me"
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry
[Verse 1: Ed Robertson]
Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know
The vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver
 [Pre-Chorus: Ed Robertson & Steven Page]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

[Chorus 2: Steven Page]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said, "You're crazy"
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Ed Robertson]
Chickity China, the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watching X-Files with no lights on
We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic
Like Sting, I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films, 'kay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing
[Pre-Chorus: Ed Robertson & Steven Page]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt

[Chorus 3: Steven Page & Ed Robertson]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to the sides and said, "I'm sorry"
Five days since I laughed at you and said
"You just did just what I thought you were gonna do"
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame but what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry

[Outro: Steven Page & Ed Robertson]
It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days 'til we say "Wasabi"

768 - Doo Wop (That Thing):Lauryn Hill
[Intro]
Yo, remember back on the Bully
When cats used to harmonize like (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Yo, yo, my men and my women
Don't forget about the deen
Sirat al-Mustaqeem
Yo, it's about a thing, uh, yo, yo
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere!
(Put them up, put them up)
(Put them up, put them up)
(Put them up, put them up)

[Verse 1]
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again
(A win win, come again
A win win, come again)
 [Hook]
Guys, you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

[Verse 2]
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
Uh-uh, come again (Yeah)
Hey, yo-yo, come again
My French men, come again
My sister, come again

That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Girls, you know you'd better watch out

769 - Lately:Divine
[Chorus]
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by

[Verse 1]
Have you ever felt a breeze hit your heart
Like the wind was blowin' it apart (blowin' it apart)
As you're spinnin' like a merry-go-round
Indications of a storm touchin' down
I wish that I could weather any storm
But I guess it was a heartbreak from the norm
Was a day I will always remember
The saddest day in sweet November

[Chorus]
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by

Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by (Watchin' the days go by)
 [Verse 2]
Baby, I'm on my knees
Prayin', "God help me, please
Bring my baby back
Right back to me" (Mmm)
If lovin' you is right
Then I don't wanna go wrong
So I drown myself with tears
Sitting here, singin' another sad love song

[Chorus]
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by

[Bridge]
Lately, I've been torn apart
I wish you hadn't broke my heart
I'm missin' you, babe, missin' you every day
Lately, I've been torn apart
I wish you hadn't broke my heart
I'm missin' you babe, missin' you every day
[Chorus]
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by
Lately (I've been watchin' you)
Been thinkin' 'bout you, baby (And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watchin' the days go by

No mountains too high, for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith, oh yeah
No rivers too wide, for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray

[Pre-Chorus: R. Kelly]
And then you will see, the morning will come
And every day will be bright as the sun
All of your fears, cast them on me
I just want you to see

[Chorus: Cline Dion & R. Kelly]
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me

No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel

I saw the teardrops, and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way, let me show you a better day

And then you will see, the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears, just cast them on me

And when it's time to face the storm
I'll be right by your side

Don't you dare give up the fight (Oh no)
Just put your trust beyond the skies

771 - Have You Ever:Brandy
[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever
(Have you ever)

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been in love
Been in love so bad
You'd do anything, to make them understand
Have you ever had someone, steal your heart away
You'd give anything, to make them feel the same
Have you ever searched for words to get you in their heart
But you don't know what to say
And you don't know where to start?

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words

Have you ever, have you ever
(Have you ever), (Oh)
 [Verse 2]
Have you ever found the one
You've dreamed of all of your life
You'd just about anything, to look into their eyes
Have you finally found the one, you've given your heart to
Only to find that one, won't give their heart to you
Have you ever closed your eyes and dreamed that they were there
And all you can do is wait, for the day when they will care

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
(Makes you wanna break down and cry)
Have you, have you ever needed something (So, so bad)
(So bad you can't sleep at night)
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't, come out right, (Oh)
Have you ever, have you ever, ever ever, (Oh)

What do I gotta do to get you in my arms, baby
What do I gotta say to get to your heart
To make you understand, how I need you next to me
Gotta get you in my world
'Cause, baby, I can't sleep

Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you, have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night

Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right (Oh)

Have you ever
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night (Just can't sleep at night)
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right? (Don't come out right)
Have you ever, have you ever, ever, ever
Have you ever?11

780 - Unpretty:TLC
[Verse 1: T-Boz]
I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror, who's inside there?
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
My outsides look cool, my insides look blue
Every time I think I'm through, it's because of you
I tried different ways, but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

[Chorus: T-Boz & Chilli]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that made me feel
So damn unpretty
Yeah, I'll make you feel unpretty too
 [Verse 2: T-Boz & Chilli]
Never insecure until I met you, now I'm bein' stupid
I used to be so cute to me, just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things to keep you happy?
Maybe get rid of you and then I'll get back to me (Heyeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
My outsides look cool, my insides look blue
Every time I think I'm through, it's because of you
I tried different ways, but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
Can't believe I'm trippin'

[Chorus: T-Boz & Chilli]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that made me feel
So damn unpretty

[Chorus: T-Boz & Chilli]
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that made me feel
So damn unpretty
[Post-Chorus: T-Boz & Chilli]
And make you feel unpretty too
And make you feel unpretty

You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
That M.A.C. can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that made me feel
So damn unpretty
You can buy your hair if it won't grow (Hahahaha)
You can buy all the make-up

Boy, your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey & JAY-Z]
Boy, if I do
The things you want me to
Uh-huh
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby
Uh-huh
Or leave me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?

It's a shame to be

When you smile at me
And you tell me the things
That you know
Persuade me to relinquish my love
To you
But I cannot resist at all
[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Boy, if I do
The things you wanna do
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby (Love me, oh)
Or leaving me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
(Heartbreaker, you got the best of me)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me (You got the best)
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (I keep on, keep on)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
(Why, why did you have to run your game?)
I should have known right from the start
(The start that you'd go and break my heart)
You'd go and break my heart

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I'm all over ready
Okay, cool, alright
She wanna shop with Jay
Play box with Jay
She wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spying again
She wanna roll with Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my date
She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms
She calls me heartbreaker
When we apart, it makes her want a piece of paper
Scribble down "I hate ya", but she knows she loves Jay because
She loves everything Jay say, Jay does, and all

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
(Oh boy, you got the best of me)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (I keep on coming back)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me
(Why did you have to run your game?)
I should have known right from the start
(Right from the start that you'd)
You'd go and break my heart (Go and break my heart)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me?
(I should have known) I should have known right from the start
(That you would go and break my heart)
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
(Boy, if I do) Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
(The things you want me to)
(The way I used to do)
Oh, why did you have to (Would you love me, baby?)
Run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
(Or leave me feeling used) Right from the start
(Would you go and break?) (My heart)
You'd go and break my heart

782 - Smooth:Santana featuring Rob Thomas
[Verse 1]
Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well, I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My munequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason, the step in my groove

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

[Chorus]
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on the radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow, turnin' you round and round
 [Pre-Chorus]
And if you said, "This life ain't good enough"
I'd give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth, and

[Chorus]
Oh, and it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth, yeah

784 - Imma Be:The Black Eyed Peas
[Prod. Drumma Boy]

Verse 1:
They overdosing on my swag
Put the whole god damn hood in rehab
Too many rumples in my duffle
Can't close this bag its so much cash
I need 10 hands now to count my stash
LL Cool Gucci Mane I'm back
Never need a mask best check my stash
You must be hall-u-cin-a-tin
1st day out girl ain't you glad?
6 supermodels crashing at my pad
I should be a model drinking outta gold bottles
With some tru religion jeans sagging off my ass
Please don't crash am I goin' to fast
Touchdown anywhere I don't need no pass
Might need some gum cause I'm finna talk trash
Cuz keep em on task like a kid at class
Hater can't hit what a hater can't see
Untouchable these haters sure can't see me
He wouldn't know a hit if you hit him in the head
With a 4 by 4 standing 6 foot 3
Ready for a bitch, crocodile dun sheet
Never met a girl I ain't fuck first week
You never seem a g throw a 10,000 white mink
On the floor live on B.E.T (Gucci)
 [Hook]
I only got life I can live
There's only so much game I can give
So you could watch the show chillin' at your crib
And weeks turn to months, and months turn to years
But I be smoking dro, Ima fuck some hoes
Ima ball today, wake up, then go ball some more
Can't tell a grown man what to do with his
It's your prerogative Ima mind my biz
But Ima live the life, forever rocking ice
Throwing money popping bottles cause that's just what I like
(x2)

Verse 2:
Screaming I'mma be like the Black Eyed Peas
I wanna be free and you wanna be me
Best eased if you really want beef
Ima fight you by the trees looking like swiss cheese
Just came home ain't thinking bout sleep
Bitch ya favorite rapper ain't slept in weeks
Thinkin' bout me like I'm down the street
Know it's over soon as my feet touch concrete
Pull up in South Beach blowing on trees
Whipping down the street like I'm riding on D's
A new ferrari flying down Peachtree
Girl I might roll ya window down Gucci Mane please
Make sure 2010 I'm free,fall off in the booth like 1017
Before I'm through fire jumping out the roof but we dont need water please bring more weed
Niggas can't win now they wanna switch teams, can't entertain that by no means
You wanna get on nigga chase your dreams,stop chasing me down like a dope fiend
Starting off my day with an M-16, shit ain't been the same since I turned 16
My whole life changed, now it's so icy
1st album on the charts came out same week (Gucci)
[Hook]

Verse 3:
My auntie had a stroke and she still can't speak, wrote me every week real talk thats deep
Ex-cell mate gotta 35 piece, won't be released till 2033
It's my son's birthday my boy turned 3, and looking at him is like looking at me
Can't look back and watch the moves I make
But the moves that I made fuck around and move me

787 - Nothin' on You:B.o.B featuring Bruno Mars
[Chorus: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Nothin' on you, baby
They might say "Hi"
And I might say "Hey"
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
(Yeah) Nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you, ha!
Yeah

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I know you feel where I'm comin' from (From)
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done (Done)
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun (The fun)
On the carousel, so around I spun (Spun)
With no directions, just tryna get some (Some?)
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun (Sun?)
And so I lost more than I had ever won (Won)
And honestly, I ended up with none (Huh?)
 [Verse 2: B.o.B]
There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go
(Go, go, go, go, hey)

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world

Nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you

Because your style, they ain't really got nothin' on (Nothin')
And you wild when you ain't got nothin' on (Ha-ha-ha)
Baby, you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes (Huh)
And you keep it real while them others stay plastic (Plast')
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic (Ha)
Stop, now think about it

[Verse 4: B.o.B]
I've been to London (Yeah), I've been to Paris (Yeah)
Even way out there to Tokyo (Tokyo?)
Back home down in Georgia (Yeah) to New Orleans (Yeah)
But you always steal the show (Steal the show)
And just like that, girl, you got me froze (Got me froze)
Like a Nintendo 64 (64)
If you never knew, well, now you know
(Know, know, know, know, hey)

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls (Yeah)

Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you
They might say "Hi" (Hi)
And I might say "Hey" (Hey)
But you shouldn't worry (Ha-ha)
About what they say (Why?)
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you

Everywhere I go
I'm always hearin' your name (Name)
And no matter where I'm at
Girl, you make me wanna sing (Sing)
Whether a bus or a plane (Plane)
Or a car or a train (Train)
No other girl's on my brain
And you the one to blame

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls (Yeah)
All over the world (All over)
I could be chasin' (Ha-ha)
But my time would be wasted (Why?)
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you

789 - Not Afraid:Eminem
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
Yeah
To take a stand (To take a stand)
It's been a ride
Everybody (Everybody)
I guess I had to
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
Go to that place to get to this one
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Now some of you
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Might still be in that place
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
If you're tryna get out
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Just follow me, I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's
Still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a "fuck you" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
 [Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehh"
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out
But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

790 - California Gurls:Katy Perry featuring Snoop Dogg
[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Verse 1: Katy Perry, Snoop Dogg]
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be somethin' in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Layin' underneath the palm trees (Yeah, undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek (What? At us)

Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love

Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle

Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock

Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (Uh)
The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys bangin' out
All that ass hangin' out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just the king and a queenie
Katy, my lady (Yeah?)
Lookie here, baby (Uh-huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you representin' California (Oh-oh, yeah)

791 - Love the Way You Lie:Eminem featuring Rihanna
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it, "Wait!
Where you going?", "I'm leaving you!", "No, you ain't!
Come back!", We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
 [Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna
[Chorus: Rihanna & Eminem]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

792 - Teenage Dream:Katy Perry
[Verse 1]
You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Verse 2]
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete
 [Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)

[Chorus]
(You make me)
You make me feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back (No)
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real (Oh), so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
[Outro]
I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans

Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?" I say

When I see your face (Face, face)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (Amazing)

'Cause, girl, you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)

I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother askin' if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face (Face, face)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)

Hey, over there
Please forgive me if I'm coming on too strong

And they're playing my favorite song
So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, a little question
Wanna know just how you feel

If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight

So, I'm asking you tonight

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

Convertible drop feel, '87, the top peeled back

Na-na-na, come on (come on, come on)
I like it, like it, come on (come on, come on)
I like it, like it, come on (come on, come on)
I like it, like it, come on (come on, come on)
I like it, like it
S, S, S and M, M, M
S, S, S and M, M, M
Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say, "Ah, ah, ah, " I like it, like it
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
Na-na-na, come on (come on, come on)
I like it, like it, come on (come on, come on)
I like it, like it, come on (come on, come on)
I like it, like it, come on (come on, come on)
I like it, like it
S, S, S and M, M, M

804 - Rolling in the Deep:Adele
[Verse 1]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Verse 2]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
 [Pre-Chorus]
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

[Bridge]
Throw your soul through every open door (Ooh woah, oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (Woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Ooh woah, oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

[Breakdown]
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could've had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all, yeah (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[Chorus]
We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat153

807 - Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.):Katy Perry
[Verse 1]
There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah
 [Post-Chorus]
But this Friday night
Do it all again
But this Friday night
Do it all again

[Verse 2]
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah
[Post-Chorus]
But this Friday night
Do it all again (Do it all again)
This Friday night
Do it all again (Do it all again)
This Friday night

[Bridge]
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F

[Saxophone Solo]

[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night

809 - Someone Like You:Adele
[Verse 1]
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Verse 2]
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
 [Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

[Breakdown]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

812 - Set Fire to the Rain:Adele
[Produced by Fraser T. Smith]

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
 [Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time
[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you

[Chorus]
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Outro]
Oh
Oh, no
Let it burn
Oh
Let it burn
Let it burn106

813 - Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You):Kelly Clarkson
[Verse 1]
You know the bed feels warmer
Sleepin' here alone (Sleepin' here alone)
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want (Do the things I want)

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'll come running back
Baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong

[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
 [Verse 2]
You heard that I was starting over with someone new
They told you I was moving on and over you

[Pre-Chorus]
You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You tried to break me, but you see

[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

[Bridge]
Thanks to you, I got a new thing started
Thanks to you, I'm not the broken-hearted
Thanks to you I'm finally thinkin' 'bout me
You know in the end, the day you left was just my beginning
In the end
[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone (What doesn't kill you)
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I (What doesn't kill you)
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger (Stronger)
Stand a little taller (Taller)
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone (What doesn't kill you)

814 - Part of Me:Katy Perry
[Verse 1]
Days like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade

[Pre-Chorus]
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Verse 2]
I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
 [Pre-Chorus]
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Bridge]
Now look at me, I'm sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won't ever put me out again
I'm glowing, oh whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring
It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact, you can keep everything
Yeah, yeah, except for me
[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no (Away from me)
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul (My soul)
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Refrain]
This is the part of me (No)
Away from me (No)
This is the part of me (Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me)
No

[Outro]
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no25

815 - We Are Young:Fun featuring Janelle Mone
[Verse 1: Nate Ruess]
Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom
Getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget it
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
 [Verse 2: Nate Ruess]
Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a toast
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun

[Bridge: Janelle Mone & Nate Ruess]
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight
The moon is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight?
The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come and carry me home?
[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun

[Outro: Nate Ruess]
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home tonight108

816 - Somebody That I Used to Know:Gotye featuring Kimbra
[Verse 1: Gotye]
Now and then, I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Gotye]
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that, though
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
 [Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Kimbra]
Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ah)
And I don't even need your love (Ooh)
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough (Ah)
No, you didn't have to stoop so low (Ooh)
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (Ah)
I guess that I don't need that, though (Ooh)
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
[Outro: Gotye, Gotye & Kimbra]
Somebody (I used to know)
Somebody (Now, you're just somebody that I used to know)
Somebody (I used to know)
Somebody (Now, you're just somebody that I used to know)
(I used to know)
(That I used to know)
(I used to know)

818 - We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together:Taylor Swift
[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
 [Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, "Never say never"
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you"
And I'm like, "I just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever"

[Chorus]
(No) We are never, ever, ever getting back together

You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war

And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

[Verse 2]
Try to tell you "no," but my body keeps on telling you "yes"

This is fucking awesome (Now)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Walk into the club like, "What up? I got a big cock"
Nah, I'm just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, "Damn, that's a cold-ass honkey"
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents (Bag it)
Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it, man, I am stunting and flossin'
And saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain, bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie-brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, "Ah, he got the Velcros"
 [Chorus: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up

I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm diggin', I'm diggin', I'm searchin' right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button-
Up shirt 'cause right now, I'm up in here stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
I'm not, I'm not stuck on searchin' in that section (Men's)
Your grammy, your auntie, your mama, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies second hand and rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, "Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight"
I'm like, "Yo, that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt"
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella dope
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryna get girls from a brand? Man, you hella won't
Man, you hella won't

824 - When I Was Your Man:Bruno Mars
[Verse 1]
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man

[Verse 2]
Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
 [Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man

[Bridge]
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that
I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you love to dance
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man179

825 - Just Give Me a Reason:Pink featuring Nate Ruess
[Verse 1: P!nk]
Right from the start
You were a thief, you stole my heart
And I, your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch, you fixed them

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
Now you've been talking in your sleep
Oh, oh, things you never say to me
Oh, oh, tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

[Chorus: P!nk]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Verse 2: Nate Ruess, P!nk]
I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear, we still have everything
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah, but this is happening)
 [Pre-Chorus: Nate Ruess, P!nk & Nate Ruess, P!nk]
You've been having real bad dreams
Oh, oh, you used to lie so close to me
Oh, oh, there's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love, love

[Chorus: P!nk & Nate Ruess, Nate Ruess]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
I've never stopped
You're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Bridge: P!nk, Nate Ruess]
Oh, tears ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust
But our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No, nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean
[Chorus: P!nk & Nate Ruess]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's still written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Outro: P!nk]
Oh-oh, we can learn to love again
Oh-oh, can learn to love again
Oh-oh
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

826 - Can't Hold Us:Macklemore & Ryan Lewis featuring Ray Dalton
Ay, ay, ay
Good to see you
Come on in, let's go
Yeah, let's go, hahaha
Alright, alright, okay, uh
Alright, okay, alright, okay
Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Lookin' for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of gettin' on the Internet and checkin' on who hit me, get up
Thrift-shop, pimp strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can't copy, yup
Bad, moonwalkin', and this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway
And we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was 14, with the four-track bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the back, pack, fat, cat, crushin'
Labels out here, now, they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give that to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
Labels out here, now, they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give it to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I've got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing this song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (Hey, hey, hey)
Learn from that failure gain humility (Hey, hey, hey)
And then we keep marching, I said
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, let's go
Na, na, na, na, na, na-na, na
Hey (And all my people say)
Na, na, na, na, na, na-na, na
Hey (And all my people say)
Na, na, na, na, na, na-na, na
Oh-oh-oh-oh, and all my people say
Na, na, na, na, na, na-na, na
Mack-le-e-e-e-e-more
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

828 - Roar:Katy Perry
[Verse 1]
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar
 [Verse 2]
Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Got up)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar

829 - Wrecking Ball:Miley Cyrus
[Verse 1]
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

[Chorus 1]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

[Verse 2]
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
 [Chorus 1]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me

[Chorus 2]
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

[Bridge]
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you win
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should've let you win

[Breakdown]
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
[Chorus 1]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me

Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me

830 - Royals:Lorde
[Verse 1]
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

[Pre-Chorus]
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
 [Verse 2]
My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

[Pre-Chorus]
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tiger's on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
[Bridge]
(Oh, oh-oh)
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen
(Oh, oh-oh)
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

831 - The Monster:Eminem featuring Rihanna
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy)
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (ooh)
Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get, it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep, one sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
Make that, straw into gold, chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

834 - All of Me:John Legend
[Verse 1]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
 [Verse 2]
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful, too

My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]

Risking it all, though it's hard

Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning

839 - Blank Space:Taylor Swift
[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
"Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
 [Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
"Oh, my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over (Over), mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game (And you love the game)
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Yeah)

She is always right there when I need her

[Verse 2]
She walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle, yeah, yeah
'Cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
 [Pre-Chorus]
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really 'cause

[Chorus]
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Bridge]
Hmm, she gives me love and affection
Baby, did I mention?
You're the only girl for me
No, I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too
She thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do
Is just for me to pop the question

[Chorus]
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her46

846 - Hello:Adele
[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
 [Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
[Chorus]
So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Anymore
[Chorus]
Hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

847 - Sorry:Justin Bieber
[Written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Justin Bieber]

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Drop]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
 [Verse 2]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

[Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm not just tryna get you back on me (Oh, no, no)
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body (Your body)
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Drop]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down (I know I let you down)
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down (I know I let you down)
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?101

848 - Love Yourself:Justin Bieber
[Produced by Benny Blanco]

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
 [Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself150

855 - Closer:The Chainsmokers featuring Halsey
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
Four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

856 - Black Beatles:Rae Sremmurd featuring Gucci Mane
[Intro: Swae Lee & Gucci Mane]
Black Beatles in the city
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys
(Ear Drummers)
Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike WiLL
I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive 'em
But you said you didn't need them (Mike WiLL Made-It!)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (They know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Tryna get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinking (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (And they lose it)

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see 'em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', "Everybody's famous!"
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'
 [Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (They know me)

Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin' (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (And they lose it)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' llello to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (They know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Tryna get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin' (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (And they lose it)
[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (They know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Tryna get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin' (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (And they lose it)

Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall, took the year like a bandit
Bought Mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop lookin' lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces

A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead

Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

We push and pull like a magnet do

One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead

859 - Humble:Kendrick Lamar
Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way (yeah, yeah!)
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact, I'm downin' this
D'USSE with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste buds?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down, we playin' Tetris
A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know
Bitch, be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)

Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man?
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Lookin' for the one?
Well, bitch, you're lookin' at the one
I'm the best yet, and yet my best is yet to come
'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody
Not just any fuckin' body
Don't make me catch a body
That's for any and everybody
Oh my God, she hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch, you blow my high
That's like turnin' gold to bronze, roll my eyes
And when she on the molly, she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie
But it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God, forgive me! Tunechi F finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out the Crescent
Fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula Gang, winnin' record
I'm just flexin' on my exes, oh God

Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth

Don't let the only real one intimidate ya
See you watchin', don't run outta time now

862 - Look What You Made Me Do:Taylor Swift
[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
 [Verse 2]
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
[Bridge]
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
"Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead!" (Oh)

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me

Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)

When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth

Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah
[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug

I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall

I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved168

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles

Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go
 [Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Bridge]
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now (Star)
I'm talkin' Time, Rolling Stone, and Bazaar now (Bazaar now)
Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down (What?)
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now
 [Chorus]
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

[Bridge]
I lost my heart and my mind
I try to always do right
I thought I lost you this time
You just came back in my life
You never gave up on me (Why don't you?)
I'll never know what you see (Why won't you?)
I don't do well when alone (Oh yeah)
You hear it clear in my tone

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm heartless (Ooh)
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless158

886 - Thank God I Found You:Mariah Carey featuring Joe and 98 Degrees
[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I would give up everything
Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering
I finally found unvarnished truth
I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heartache would not subside
I felt like dying
Until you saved my life

[Chorus: All]
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you

[Verse 2: Joe & 98]
I will give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you
'Cause without you beside me I can't survive
Don't wanna try
If you keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be alright
'Cause I need you in my life
 [Chorus: All]
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby, I'm so thankful I found you

[Bridge: All]
See, I was so desolate before you came to me
Looking back
I guess it shows that we were destined
To shine over the rain, to appreciate
The gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel
This way

[Chorus: 98 with ad-libs from Mariah Carey & Joe]
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby, I'm so thankful I found
You

Monday night and I feel so low
I count the hours, but they go so slow

City lights, streets of gold
Look out my window to the world below
Moves so fast, but it feels so cold

891 - Everything You Want:Vertical Horizon
[Verse 1]
Somewhere there's speaking
It's already coming in
Oh, and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why
But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

[Chorus 1]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Verse 2]
You're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say
 [Chorus 1]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Bridge]
But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

[Verse 3]
Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away the
Anger of angels who won't return
[Chorus 1]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Chorus 2]
I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you
And I don't know why

[Outro]
And I don't know why
Why
I don't know9

And if I fall along the way
Pick me up and dust me off

Wait around, I'll smile again

I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together
Yeah, you're breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent6

894 - Incomplete:Sisq
[Intro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Oh yeah yeah, uh
Listen

[Verse 1]
Bright lights, fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still, I'm lonely now
Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines
From their covers to my covers, wanna lay with me
Fame and fortune still can't find
Just a grown man runnin' out of time

[Chorus]
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you, girl, my life is incomplete
Said, without you girl, ahh
Listen
 [Verse 2]
Your perfume, your sexy lingerie
Girl, I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was
It's been a year, winter, summer, spring and fall
But bein' without you just ain't livin' ain't nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

[Chorus]
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you, girl, my life is incomplete
Oh yeah, that without you, girl, ahh

[Bridge]
I just can't help lovin' you
But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything, ha
And everything
To hear you say
That you'll stay
[Chorus]
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
(All of the women, all of the money)
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything (Just give me my baby)
But I can't pretend that I don't see (Yeah, yeah)
That without you, girl, my life is incomplete
(Without you, alright, alright, alright)
Even though it seems I have everything  (Even though it seems)
I don't wanna be a lonely fool (That I got everything)
All of the women, all the expensive cars
(I don't have you, I don't have you, you make me wanna cry, baby)
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything (Oh)
But I can't pretend that I don't see (Baby, hey, yeah)

899 - Independent Women:Destiny's Child
* a parody of "Independent Women" by Destiny's Child

Oh, oh yo
Question tell me what you know about me
At the dice game nothing less than a G
Got my own ride and I got my own bread
Even bought the chicken scrap wig on your head
Question, ask me how i feel about chicks
Best be independent cause you ain't gettin' shit
The only time I trick is December 25th
I'm coming with a rolls, some kicks, and some dick

There's one thing worse then a chick saying "I just want chedda"
Uh-oh, that's a motherfuckin' child's support letter
First she want her bills paid now she independent
Sounds more like these chicks is inconsistent
These days everybody wanna male bash
I tell 'em real fast to kiss my male ass
Listen, this is how it works
I want to fuck you on my money
Baby it just who gets who first
Now you all hurt telling the word nonsense
It ain't my fault you fell in love in the process
Got pregnant young now hun is stuck
But if I'm taking care of my son then shut the fuck up
Bitch I got no time to hear your heart broke
I owe like two months rent and a fucking car note
Take it as a quote not an answer back
And if so suck my dick, somebody answer that
 Cause the clothes on my kid
(I bought it)
Everything in my crib
(I bought it)
The lawyer from my bid
(I bought it)
Even though I lost the case
(But I fought it)
The telly i bring my hoes

Get money fuck a bitch

All my niggas who gettin' paper

All my niggas who keeps it gravy

Understanding that life ain't easy
(Throw your hands up with me)

Yo man I'm independent cause I know
I can spend my last on a fresh jar of 'dro
And still up to date with the Benz for the crib
And helpin' mom dukes keepin' food in the fridge
(Answer) Don't ever judge a nigga by his dough
He could be independent whether rich or poor
As long as you know where all your money go
Niggas know when not to give a fuck about a ho
Check it out, my life hard man
All I gotta do is flip
Chicks want a yard all they gotta do is strip, its that easy
A brother want a check, he get a job
Some chicks want a check, they get pregnant
That ain't right, but fuck it, it's straight blood
Wanna wreck a nigga's life for two hundred dollars a month
Won't let you see your seed actin' like it's funny
She gettin' her hair done with that diaper money
Independent, I know cats that's fightin' to live
A week won't eat to keep lights in the crib
Gas in the tank, shoes on the act
California plates with dubes on the back
I'm just here to stack on digits
So happen I get paid to come back on bitches
Rep my niggas, get brain and keep on skeetin'
We keep on with these hoes, we gon' keep on eatin'

Cause the rims on my jeep

The Timbs on my feet

And I don't give a fuck

[Intro: Rikrok & Shaggy]
Yo, man
Yo
Open up, man
Yo, what you want, man?
My girl just caught me

The girl next door, ya know?
Man

Say it wasn't you
Alright

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door

Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
How ya fi give the woman access to your villa?
Trespasser and a witness, all the hacklin' a yuh pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killa
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player, you haffi know how fi play
If she say, "A night," convince her, say, "A day"
Never admit to a word weh she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, "Baby, no way!"
 [Pre-Chorus: Rikrok & Shaggy]
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?

[Verse 2: Shaggy]
Mek she know say that she really no have right fi vex
A never you she see yah make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else weh favor you inna di complex
Seein' is believin', so you better change your specs
You know she a go bring a whole heap a things up from the past
All the likkle evidence, you betta know fi mask
Quick 'pon yuh answer, know how fi talk
But if she pack a gun, you know you betta run fast
[Pre-Chorus: Rikrok & Shaggy]
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wa-wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me
[Bridge: Rikrok]
Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin', it makes no sense at all
Need to tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player, but you're completely lost
That's why I sing
[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me79

902 - Butterfly:Crazy Town
[Chorus]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby

[Verse 1]
Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passin', I'm askin', "Could this be real?"
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel, too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so yo, I'm puttin' it down

[Chorus]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
 [Verse 2]
I don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious, then I guess it's true
But to tell the truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happenin' now?
I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so

[Chorus]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

[Verse 3]
Hey sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, it's me and you like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' 'bout butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss
[Breakdown]
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So come and dance with me
Uh huh, uh huh

[Chorus]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

[Outro]
Come and dance with me (Yeah)
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me (Yeah)
Come and dance with me, uh-ha, uh-ha
Come and dance with me (Yeah)

906 - U Remind Me:Usher
[Intro]
Yo, I ain't seen you in a minute
But I got something to tell you
Listen

[Verse 1]
See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kind of hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
See this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

[Chorus]
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

[Verse 2]
Thought that she was the one for me
Til I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexing everyone, but me
This is why we could never be
 [Chorus]
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

[Bridge]
I know it's so unfair to you (it's so unfair)
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew
Wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me (you remind me)

[Chorus]
Whoa whoa oh oh oh oh
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you, (gotta let you go)
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (all the shit she put me through)
This is why I just can't get with you, no no
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

[Intro: Ja Rule & Jennifer Lopez]
(Murder Inc)
What's my motherfuckin' name?!
R-U-L-E
Blowin' back on this Mary Jane, I'm analyzin' the game
And the game done chose me
To bring pain to pussy niggas & pussy hoes
They're one in the same
Ever since you told me
There's only room for two, I've been makin' less room for you
Now only God can hold me
Hug me, love me, judge me
The only man that hovers above me, holla

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
I met so many men and it's like they're all the same
My appetite for loving is now my hunger pain
And when I'm feeling sexy, who's gonna comfort me?
My only problem is their insecurity

[Pre-Chorus: Ja Rule, Jennifer Lopez, Together]
Tired of being alone? Yeah, yeah
Sick of arguing on the phone? Yeah, yeah
Are you telling all your friends (Yeah, yeah)
That your nigga don't understand my love?
 [Chorus: Jennifer Lopez, Ja Rule, Together]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

[Verse 2: Ja Rule with Jennifer Lopez]
Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout this relationship
And I wanna know is this as good as it gets?
'Cause we've been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time, even if it was part-time
Now they been lookin' at me, smilin' at me
Laughin' like we wasn't happy
But not knowin' that we're growin' and we gettin' married
Hard lovin' and straight thuggin'
Bitch, I ain't doin' this shit for nothing
I'm here to get it poppin', hop in', let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowin' in the wind, sun glistenin' off my skin, hey
I'm nasty, heh, you know me
But you still don't fuck with your baby

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez, Ja Rule, Together]
'Cause I'm real

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Now people lovin' me and hating me, treating me ungratefully
But not knowing that they ain't making or breaking me
My life I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again
Now people screaming what the deal with you and so and so
I tell them niggas mind their biz, but they don't hear me though
'Cause I live my life to the limit and I love it
Now I could breathe again, baby, now I could breathe again

911 - U Got It Bad:Usher
[Intro]
Ooh-oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ooh

[Verse 1]
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been there, done it, humped around, ha
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

[Chorus]
(You) You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone (Oh yeah), hang up and you call right back
(Oh you) You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad
 [Verse 2]
When you say that you love 'em and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (You can have it all and)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just 'cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know, I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her, "I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world"
Ladies, say, "I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can"

[Pre-Chorus]
See, I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad (Hey, hey, no, no)
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, ha, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track (Yeah)
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house (Oh, you're stuck)
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about (Look at yourself)
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else (Somebody)
You got it bad
[Electric Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else31

912 - How You Remind Me:Nickelback
[Verse 1]
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of livin' like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me

[Pre-Chorus]
This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

[Post-Chorus]
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no

[Verse 2]
It's not like you didn't know that
I said, "I love you," and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause livin' with me must have damn near killed you
 [Pre-Chorus]
And this is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

[Post-Chorus]
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no

[Bridge]
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealin'
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me
[Pre-Chorus]
This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

[Outro]
Yet, yet, are we havin' fun yet?
Yet, yet, are we havin' fun yet?
Yeah, yeah (These five words in my head scream)
Are we havin' fun yet?
Yeah, yeah (These five words in my head)
No, no43

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyein' me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin' your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care
 [Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call

Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like, the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money over bitches, Murder, I.N.C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care
[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time
And I gave you my all
Now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time (yeah)
And I gave you my all (yo)
Now baby be mine

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Oh I, feelin' like you livin' a, double life
'Cause you don't be coming home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checking for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care
[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time
And I gave you my all
Now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time
And I gave you my all

918 - A Moment Like This:Kelly Clarkson
[Verse 1]
What if I told you it was all meant to be?
Would you believe me? Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling that we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now

[Chorus]
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this

[Verse 2]
Everything changes, but beauty remains
Something so tender, I can't explain
Well, I may be dreamin', but 'til I awake
Can we make this dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love we share

[Chorus]
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
 [Bridge]
Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall (Fall)
So let me tell you this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment...

919 - Lose Yourself:Eminem
[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better
 [Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better
[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better
[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

Love is life and life is living
It's very special
All my love
Oh-oh-oh
Uh, baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Very special
Baby, don't go, uh

Baby, don't go, yeah

Baby, don't go, yeah, yeah
Why you actin' like that?

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
It's such a shame, but I'm leaving (Uh)
Can't take the way you mistreated me (Uh)
And it's crazy, but oh, baby (Come on, yo, uh, uh, uh)
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man
 [Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (What you want, baby?)
I gotta leave you alone (Come on now)
'Cause I'm good, holding down my spot
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block (Don't go, baby)
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right? (Come on, baby)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
The nights I waited up for you (Oh, boy)
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you (Uh, uh, uh)
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town (Creepin')
I thought my tender touch could lock you down (Yeah)
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now (Come here)
Stop playing (Haha, aw), you gaming
I gotta leave you alone (What you want now?)
[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
'Cause I'm good holding my spot
Stop acting like that
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block
Now you know you need to stop
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?
Here we go

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

[Verse 3: LL Cool J & Jennifer Lopez]
People make mistakes to make up, to break up, to wake up
Cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me, you love me (Oh)
I'm like your homie, instead of beefin', come hold me
I promise I'm not a phony, don't bounce, baby, console me (Come here)
Ain't nothing you can say to me that
Can change my mind, I got to let you go now (Chill, baby)
And nothing will ever be the same, so just (Yeah)
Be on your way, go ahead and do your thing now (Baby, don't go)
And there's no more to explain to me, you know (Come on, now)
I know your game and I'm not feeling what you do (Come on, now)
So I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (Don't bounce)
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah (Don't bounce, don't bounce, baby)
[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
All my pride is all I have (Don't bounce, baby)
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad (Don't bounce, baby)
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad (Uh)
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh
All my pride is all I have (Don't bounce, baby)
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have (Baby, don't go)
You'll be needing me, but too bad (You're everything to me)
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad (You mean everything to me, baby)
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own (We all make mistakes, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah (I still love you, baby)
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh (I'll always love you, baby)

New York City
You are now rocking, with 50 Cent
You gotta love it
I just wanna chill and twist the lah
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?
If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz, would you poof and disappear
Like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends that you feelin' me?
In the bed if I used my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink, you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that (like that)
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now (woo)
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?
Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm loving?
Are you mad 'cause I'm asking you twenty-one questions?
Are you my soulmate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes, to make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me
Could you love me in a Bentley? (Girl)
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask twenty-one questions, and they all about us
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask twenty-one questions, and they all about us

925 - This Is the Night:Clay Aiken
[Verse 1]
When the world wasn't upside down
I could take all the time I had
But I'm not gonna wait when a moment can vanish so fast
'Cause every kiss is a kiss you can never get back

[Chorus]
Lift me up in your eyes
If you told me that is what heaven is
Well, you'd be right
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night

[Verse 2]
When the answer to all my dreams
Is as close as a touch away
Why am I here holding back what I'm trying to say?

[Chorus]
Lift me up in your eyes
If you told me that is what heaven is
Well, you'd be right
Hold me close to your heart
I would go with you to the ends of the earth
And we'll fly
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night
 [Bridge]
This is the night where we capture forever
And all our tomorrows begin
After tonight, we will never be lonely again

[Chorus]
Lift me up in your eyes
If you told me that is what heaven is
Well, you'd be right
Hold me close to your heart
I would go with you to the ends of the earth
And we'll fly
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night

[Intro 2: Nelly & Diddy]
We do it for fun
We just do it for fun
Derrty ENT
We do it for fun
Bad Boy (Nelly, Diddy, Murphy Lee)
(This is history baby)
We do it for fun

And the band played on
We do it for fun
Singing my song
We do it for fun
Bad Boys 2, the soundtrack
Let's go

[Verse 1: Nelly]
Come here girl, what your name is?
Where you from? Turn around; who you came with?
Is that your ass or your mama half reindeer?
I can't explain it but damn sure glad you came here
I'm still a sucker for cornrows, you know I never changed that
Your body is banging mama, but where your brains at?
I'm still the same cat when I was younger running with bad boys
But now I'm on the hook and so I'm running with Bad Boy
Here come another man, unlike no other man
Candy coated (what!) switching every other lane
Lord help me, why don't cha please help me
Eighth girl this week and it's only Tuesday
I like the cocky bowlegged ones
Black, white and Dominicans
Hispanics and Asians, please shake it for Nelly San
Manolos, Ma-no-no's, I can't tell
Everybody ain't that rich, just when you do it, do it well
 [Chorus: Nelly &  (Diddy)]
Let me see you take it low
(Girl, go and take it low)
We can even do it slow
(We can even do it slow)
Take it where you want to go
(Take it where you want to go)
Just take that ass to the floor
(Pop something, move something, shake ya tailfeather)
(Girl, go and take it low)
We can even do it slow
(We can even do it slow)
Take it where you want to go
(Take it where you want to go)

Now real girls get down on the floor (On the floor)
Now get that money, honey, act like you know (Like you know)
Mama, I like how you dance, the way you fit in them pants (Uh)
And to the floor (Uh) take it low (Uh) girl, do it again (Uh)
You know I love that (I love that)
Now where them girls at? (Where the girls at?)
It's Diddy, Murphy Lee, and Nelly, how you love that? (Shit, uh oh)
Come on, we got another one player
From New York to the Dirty, how they loving it player?
Baby, you impressive, let's get
To know each other
You the best of the best and
You got to love it in the dresses, the sexiest
I had to tell her she's a young Janet Jackson live in living color
Look here mama you're dead wrong for having them pants on
Capri's cut low so when you shake it I see your thong
My pocket's full of dough, shake your feathers 'til the morning
It's Bad Boy and Nelly, man, somebody better warn them
[Chorus: Nelly & (Diddy)]
Let me see you take it low
(Girl, go and take it low)

[Bridge: Nelly]
Oh no, I heard them bad boys coming
Can't stop now
Got to continue my running (Yeah)
'Cause we gon' party 'til the lights come on
And if my song stop, fuck it 'cause my mic's still on, man

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee & (Nelly)]
Yo, I'm the big booty type
I like 'em thick with their mind right (Aw)
Banging personality, conversate when the time right (Naw)
I'm not hard, I've got women to handle that
They be like, "He the man," when I'm really a Thundercat
Come on, you know the 'Tics connect like Voltron
Collect so much grass, popo thinking we mow lawns
My Cole Haans don't match that
But it matches her headwrap and the seats that I got in the 'Lac
I'm just a Juvenile, 'cause I Be about G's
Keep the women Weezy, Mannie say they have my Babys
I'm Young like Turk, I like that Cash and that Money
(I'mma eat my money) Man, I'm that damn hungry
You see I'm starvin' like Marvin, girl
I've got sixteen bars of fire is what I'm starting
Plus my rats come in packs like Sammy and Dean Martin
And I got so many keys, you think I'm valet parking (Get it?)
[Chorus: Nelly & (Diddy)]
Let me see you take it low
(Girl, go and take it low)
We can even do it slow
(We can even do it slow)
Take it where you want to go
(Take it where you want to go)
Just take that ass to the floor

Now, they got me in the middle, feeling like a man-whore
'Specially the big girl
Big girls need love, too no discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
And let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny-slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out "Timber!" when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male-friend-boyfriend was boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail: on the low, ho

Blaow! We ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong? The club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance

But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes, got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest
Ahh, come on we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight

Get us out, so someone can gun us down
We was two songs away from getting some cut up
Now we one song away from tearing the club up
Move over; Luda got something to say
Do it now cause tomorrow ain't promised today
Work with me, let's become one with the beat
And don't worry about me stepping all over your feet

You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light, move it to some Isleys
Rims still movin' so I bump a lil' Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b, dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got the heat on the 23's
And I do it (Well well well well)
Wit' my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin' to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit' Maze
Fulfilling our every temptation
Slow jammin', havin' deep sex
You ready for the world girl, come on go wit' me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment be controlling me
I'm lovin' the way you be holdin' me when I be listenin' to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see

Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
(Hey! Hey! Luda!)

[Verse 3: Ludacris, Lil Jon & Both]
Watch out, my outfit's ridiculous
In the club, lookin' so conspicuous
And "roar!", these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow (Yeah!)
And forget about game, I'ma spit the truth (What?)
I won't stop 'til I get 'em in their birthday suit (Yeah!)
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
Then bend over to the front, and touch your toes
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cuttin', then I put 'em on foot patrol (Let's go!)
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please (Yeah!)
Ludacris fill cups like double D's (Yeah!)
Me and Ursh' once more, and we leave some dead
We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed, that say
[Chorus: Usher & Lil Jon]
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shawty got down low, she said, "come and get me"
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me, screamin'
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!

[Outro: Ludacris]

Lil Jon got the beat that make your booty go (Clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Ursher got the voice make your booty go (Clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Ludacris got the flow to make your booty go (Clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat that make your booty go (Clap)44

932 - Burn:Usher
[Intro]
Girl, I understand why
See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is somethin' I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm tryna say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming, but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you (No, no)
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn (Let it burn), let it burn (Let it burn), gotta let it burn
 [Verse 2]
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feelin' ain't the same
Find myself callin' her your name
Ladies, tell me, do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now to get my shorty back?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn)
Let it burn (Gotta let it burn, oh), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over (Know it's over), we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
[Bridge]
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, ooh
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Can you feel me burning?)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn), let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn)
Let it burn, gotta let it burn34

934 - Confessions Part II:Usher
[Intro]
Watch this

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

[Verse 1]
Now, this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told y'all I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true?
Third thing was me wishing that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say (Oh, oh)
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Yeah, yeah)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do (No)
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions (This is part two)
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (Tell it all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (I don't know, I don't know)
But to give you part two of my confessions
 [Verse 2]
Sitting here, stuck on stupid, tryin' to figure out
When, what, and how I'ma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with, over with
I'm riding in my whip, racin' to her place
Talking to myself, preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't wanna come near me
I said, "One second, baby, please hear me"

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Chick on the side, oh I)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed (So gone, so gone) and I don't know what to do
(What to do) I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (Cried, when I got it)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (Didn't know what to do)
But to give you part two of my confessions (But I need to tell you, baby)

[Interlude]
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm havin' a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please
[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions23

Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jerking
Slow down for me, a-you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping, I'm tryna grip that ass
Keep being hard-headed and I'ma make you get off me
Got human enough disguise but my face is a doggy
If you loving my bark let me bury my bone
I got four or five bad married bitches at home
One of my bitches feel in love with that outside dick
That outside dick keep them hoes sick like

She love the way the dick stay hard from 12 'til early in the morn'
Fine bitches if you listening, you heard me, I'm strong
If you going through your cycle, I ain't with it, I'm gone
You must have heard about them hoes that I beat up in my home
They wasn't telling the truth baby, you know they was wrong
Now, make it official, wind up some of that dome
I don't mind buying blue, your riding to
Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you
Lil mama my shit together, I ain't jiving you
I don't think that nigga could do you better then I could do, ya know
And Juvenile from cross the street by the derby
Same nigga that used to be running with Rusty and Kirby
Can a playa from the 'Nolia get a chance with it?
But I can't bounce with you without using my hands with it

She working that back, I don't know how to act

Slow motion, she open, I'm hoping she don't leave my dick broken
With brush burns and swollen
I'm toting, she wanted me to make her out a believer
I gurantee ya I'ma see ya when I see ya
And just don't holla out my name like we was all that
Your pussy throw back and you know that
So stop stunting, slow motion for a real nigga
I'm going off that incredible potion and I'ma deal with ya

[Verse 4: Juvenile]
I like how that Victoria Secret sit in that ass
Let me pour some more hip and Hennsey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handful?
I know what's happening, all I want is a sample
Who you with? I'm in the rental today
It's going down and happening and I remember the way
Less money we spend on bullshit, the more for the weed
What's it gonna take for you to come slow motion with me?

936 - Lean Back:Terror Squad
[Intro: Fat Joe]
Owwwwww! Yeah! My niggas, ahah
Throw your hands in the air right now, man!
Feel this shit right here, Scott Storch, nigga
Yeah Khaled, I see you nigga, ShowBiz, Born Lord
Uh, yeah, uh, yo

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I don't give a fuck about your faults or mishappens
Nigga, we from the Bronx, New York; shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the Squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga, this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a youngin, was too much to cope with
Why you think, muh'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit?
Should've been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo, kid

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
 [Verse 2: Remy Martin]
R to the Ezzy, M to the Yzzy
My arms stay breezy, the Don stay flizzy
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-4-fizzive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride 'til I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen, we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a V.I.P section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thang, nigga, we still the same niggas
Flows just changed, now we 'bout to change the game, nigga

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla: to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come then they'd proudly squeal
Cause half these rappers they blow like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm gon' hurt you
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K Crip walkin' like, "That's what's up!"
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about the Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the Rucker
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)19

You won't get no nookie or the cookies, I'm no rookie

You ain't got milk on ya tongue, slow down, lil' one
We ain't got long
Hey shorty, you little thing (Wait a minute)
You think you bad but you ain't bad
I'll show you what bad is
Bad is when you're capable of beatin' the bag
I've been workin' at it ever since I came to this planet
I ain't quite there yet, but I'm gettin' better at it
Matter of fact, let me tell it to you one mo' 'gain
All I got to do is tell a girl who I am (Petey)
Ain't ne'er chick in here that I can't have
Bada boom, bada bam, ba-bam (I'm Bad)

[Verse 5: Ciara]
You're insinuating that I'm hot
But these goodies, boy, are not
Just for any of the many men that's tryna get on top
No, you can't call me later
And I don't want your number
I'm not changin' stories
Just respect the play I'm callin'

[Chorus: Ciara]
I bet you want the goodies (Ugh)
Bet you thought about it (Yeah)
Got you all hot and bothered (Ow)
Mad 'cause I talk around it
If you're lookin' for the goodies

Baby, I just don't get it, do you enjoy bein' hurt?

Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why

[Pre-Chorus]
If I was your man, baby, you'd never worry 'bout what I do

Love you

Don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go, they stop and stare, 'cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes, out of control
Baby, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
If I was your man, baby, you'd never worry 'bout what I do
I'd be comin' home, back to you, every night, doin' you right
You're the type of woman who deserves good things
Fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby, you're a star
I just wanna show you you are

[Chorus]
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Ooh, baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me

[Bridge]
You deserve better, girl (Oh, You know you deserve better)
We should be together, girl (Baby)
With me and you, it's whatever, girl, hey
So can we make this thing ours?
[Chorus]
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to (Let me be the one to give)
Give you everything you want and need (Everything you need)
Baby, good love and protection (Said everything)
Make me your selection (Will you take me, baby?)
Show you the way love's supposed to be (Oh)
Baby, you should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need (Give you everything)
That good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be (Hey)
You should let me love you (Love you)
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need

Good love and protection (Protection)

Temperature risin', okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam-packed, hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you
Wanna show me you could work it, baby? No problem
Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick

Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door, she get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race, who could get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip 'til every bubble in every bottle is gone

I'll take you to the candy shop

Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa

I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa

942 - We Belong Together:Mariah Carey
[Intro]
Sweet love, yeah

[Verse 1]
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I shoulda held on tight, I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt

[Pre-Chorus]
The feeling that I'm feeling now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here, 'cause, baby (We belong together)

[Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who else)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who else)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together
 [Verse 2]
I can't sleep at night, when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me, "If you think you're lonely now"
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial, tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface, "I only think of you"
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm feelin' all out of my element
Throwin' things, cryin'
Tryin' to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life)
(We belong together)

[Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby
(We belong together) (Who will?)
[Post-Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me (Who will?)
It's still so hard to believe (Who will?)
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)
Who's gonna talk to me 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

[Outro]
(Who will? Who will? Who will?)

[Verse 1]
I've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation comin' around
I guess it's right, it's so amazing
Every time I see you, I'm alive

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight (Light)
All my dreams are in your eyes

[Chorus]
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

[Verse 2]
When we touch
When we love
The stars light up, the wrong becomes undone (Done)
 [Pre-Chorus 2]
Naturally, my soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight (Light)
All my dreams are in your eyes

[Chorus]
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

[Bridge]
When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows you away

[Chorus]
I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from (Wanna be inside)
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven1

Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
My baby (y'all know what this is) boy

Just let it die with no goodbyes
Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes it'd be like that, baby

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now every time I see you, I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

[Chorus]
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
But we both know nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it

There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine (We used to shine)
No matter who you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny

Forever we'd both regret

Late nights, playing in the dark

All messed up now

Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us

[Chorus]
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms (About us)
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love (About us)
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it

[Intro: Paul Wall, Jermaine Dupri & Nelly]
Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em, "Make me a grill"
Uh
Uh
Add the whole top diamond and the bottom rose gold (Yo)
We 'bout to start a epidemic with this one
Y'all know what this is (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
So So Def

[Verse 1: Nelly & Brandi Williams]
Got thirty down at the bottom, thirty more at the top (Uh-huh)
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changin' grills every day, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (Oh) in my white tee (Oh)
Or on South Beach (Oh) in my wife beat'
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see, my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
'Cause when I...
Open up your mouth, your grill gleaming (Say what?)
Eyes stay low from the chiefing (Chiefing)
I got a grill I call penny candy, you know what that mean?
It look like Now and Laters, gumdrops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave you for nothing, only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say...
 [Chorus: Brandi Williams, Nelly, Paul Wall, Nelly & Paul Wall & *Jermaine Dupri*]
Smile for me, daddy (Woo)

What it do, baby? It's the iceman, Paul Wall (Yeah)
I got my mouth lookin' something like a disco ball (Yeah)
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath (Already)
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling, showing off my diamonds, sippin' on some potent oil (Baby)
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats, thirty stacks, let 'em know I'm so for real (For real)
My motivation is them thirty pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouthpiece simply symbolize success (That's right)
I got the wristwear and neckwear that's captivating (What?)
But it's my smile that got these onlookers spectating (Hah)
My mouthpiece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad (Come on)
My teeth are mind-blowing, giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman 'cause I'm sellin' everybody grills
[Chorus: Brandi Williams, Nelly, Paul Wall, Nelly & Paul Wall & *Jermaine Dupri*]
Smile for me, daddy (Woo)
Woo, what you lookin' at? Uh

Gipp got them yellows, got them purples, got them reds (Hey)
Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head (Hey)
You can catch me in my Too $hort drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box
It's what it do, in the Lou', ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks and the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em, you can spot 'em on the top and the bottom
Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham
Ain't dissin' nobody, but let's bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white (That's right)
These hoes can't focus 'cause they eyesight blurry
Tippin' on some 4's, you can see my mouth jewelry
I got four different sets, it's a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same, got my name in the mold
Add a whole top diamond and the bottom rose gold (Come on)
[Chorus: Brandi Williams, Nelly, Paul Wall & Nelly & Paul Wall]
Smile for me, daddy (Woo)
What you lookin' at? Uh
Let me see your grill
Let you see my what?

950 - You're Beautiful:James Blunt
[Intro]
My life is brilliant
[Verse 1]
My life is brilliant, my love is pure
I saw an angel, of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan
[Chorus]
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she caught my eye, as I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was, fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you
 [Interlude]
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na

[Outro Chorus]
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel, with a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you
But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you48

Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
(It's ridiculous)
It's been months
And for some reason I just (Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this, yeah (Enough is enough)
No more walking 'round with my head down (Yeah)
I'm so over being blue
Cryin' over you

[Chorus]
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
 [Verse 2]
Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me of what used to be
That's the reason

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Bridge]
(Oh, leave me alone) Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs) Oh-oh, hey
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio

'Cause I'm so sick of love songs (Hey), so tired of tears (So tired of tears)
So done with wishin' she were still here (Oh)
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (Ooh, oh)
So why can't I turn off the radio? (Why can't I turn off the radio?)
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears (So tired of tears)
So done with wishing she were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (Hey)
Why can't I turn off the radio? (Why can't I turn off the radio?)
And I'm so sick of love songs (So sick of love songs)
So tired of tears (And I'm so sick, so sick of love song)
So done with wishing you were still here
(And I'm so sick, so sick of love songs)
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow (Hey)
So why can't I turn off the radio?

953 - Bad Day:Daniel Powter
[Verse 1]
Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Verse 2]
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Chorus]
Because you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
 [Verse 3]
Will you need a blue sky holiday?
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Chorus]
You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
(Ooh, a holiday)

[Bridge]
Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well, oh, that strong
And I'm not wrong
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Breakdown]
So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

[Chorus 2]
'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You've seen what you're like
And how does it feel?
One more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
(This feels, like, so real) Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressin', incessantly pressin' the issue
'Cause every moment gone, you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close, boy, 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me callin' out for help

This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it

[Verse 2]
Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots and when I see you, it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (Uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels (Over heels)
Boy, you keep me hangin' on, the way you make me feel

'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it

[Bridge]
Boy, you know you got me feelin' open
And boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said, boy, I'm tellin' you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm goin' crazy over you, I'm beggin'

[Chorus]
S-O-S, please, someone help me (Somebody help me, yeah)
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard (Why you makin' this hard for me, baby?)
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night (Ooh)

Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty

And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
And I'm ridin' with a new chick, she like, "Hold up"
Next to the PlayStation controller
Is a full clip and my pistola
Turn a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryin' to bone, ain't tryin' to have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol, and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up until the maximum
I can speak for some niggas tryin' to jack for some
But we packin' somethin' that we have for 'em
Will have a nigga locked up in the maximum
Security cell, I'm grippin' oak (oak)
Music loud and tippin' slow (slow)
Twin's steady twistin' like, "Hit this though"
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
The windows down, gotta stop pollution
CD change, niggas like, "Who is that producing?"
This the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston, but I'm still ain't losin'
They see me rollin'
They hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud
I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
I been drinkin' and smokin'
Holy shit 'cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home 'fore the po-po's scope this big ol' Excurs'
Just swerved, all up in the curve and
Nigga been sippin' on that Hennessey and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on the blunt
And rollin' another one up, we livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand
40-ounce on my lap freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dogs
Yo, I gotta hit the back streets
Wonderin' 'bout the six pounds and I got heat
Glock, Glock shots to the block, we creep creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me, on the low key
With no regard for the law, we dodge 'em like, "Fuck 'em all"
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark
Roll it up if you want, and get it poppin', dawg
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air, Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire
They see me rollin'
They hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud
I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Now would you think it's so? I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow
And they upset for sho', 'cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro
So they get behind me tryin' to check my tags
Look at my rear-view and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me on the wrong well keep tryin' (keep tryin')
'Cause they denyin' that it's racial profilin'
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags (tags)
Pull me over try to check my slab (slab)
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast
And bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them
Givin' a damn about 'em not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood
I'ma laugh at you and then I have to cruise
Jammin' number two on some old DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This a message to the laws tell 'em, "We hate you"
I can't be touched or tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, findin' a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me, I'm 'bout to pull up at your home, and it's on
They see me rollin'
They hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud
I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
They see me rollin'

Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud

Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty

Bo-bop-so-bop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas, 'cause we own our own boats, boats (No fighting)

957 - Do I Make You Proud:Taylor Hicks
[Verse 1]
I've never been
The one to raise my hand
That was not me
And now that's who I am
Because of you
I am standing tall

[Verse 2]
My heart is full
Of endless gratitude
You were the one
The one to guide me through
Now I can see
And I believe
It's only just beginning

[Chorus]
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?

[Verse 3]
I guess I've learned
To question is to grow
That you still have faith
Is all I need to know
I've learned to love
Myself in spite of me
And I've learned to
Walk on the road that I believe
 [Chorus]
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?

[Bridge]
Everybody needs to rise up
Everybody needs to be loved
To be loved

[Chorus]
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now (stronger than I've ever been)
Never been afraid of standing out (never been afraid)
But do I make you proud?
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
Do I make you proud?
But do I make you proud?
[Outro]
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud

Nope

[Verse 1: Nelly Furtado & Timbaland]
How you doin', young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You're dope, have a player 'bout to choke
I was at a loss for words first time that we spoke
You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right?
How you lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it?
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance (Chance)
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand (Hand)
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it?
Boy, I'm tired of runnin', let's walk for a minute

You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute
Hey, I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at? Do you mind if I come through?
I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'ma lay mine's down
I'm a big girl, I can handle myself
But if I get lonely, I'ma need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team -- So does everybody else
Shh, baby, we can keep it on the low (Low)
Let your guard down, ain't nobody gotta know (Know)
If you with it, girl, I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?

Don't get mad, don't be mean

[Verse 3: Nelly Furtado & Timbaland]
Wait, I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on
I can see you with nothin' on
Feelin' on me before you bring that on
Bring that on?! -- You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak, you shouldn't say those things
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P like Steve Nash?

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado & Timbaland]
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, I'm callin' ya name
But you're drivin' me crazy the way you're makin' me wait
Promiscuous girl, you're teasin' me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, we're one in the same
So we don't gotta play games no more

Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)

My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Girl, my love, my love
 [Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now If I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure (That, baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin' for (Just say it, "I do")
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Girl, my love, my love

Aight, it's time to get it, JT
I don't know what you hesitatin' for, man
Ay, ay, ay

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Shawty cool as a fan, on the move once again (Ay)
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (Nah)
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When they wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy (Why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire (Haha)
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean? You can't go? Why? (Why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-uh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man...)
Well, baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
St. Bart's, Anguilla, anywhere I chill (Nice)
Just bring with me a pair, I will (C'mon)
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (Love)

Normally don't get caught up too fast

966 - What Goes Around... Comes Around:Justin Timberlake
(time is an illusion)hook
This world's a fuckin big ben
Where the bullies of time increase your pain
My niggas count the money and pray the god
Pray the god to see tomorrow one more time
Mo hours mo minutes mo distress
Time is a poison which acts so slowly
No caress ,no kisses ,for the realest
Just blow,just cuts and that's it

My back 'gainst the wall
Hours all around me

My reason insensitive
But my heart feeling something

Tic toc tic tic toc
Time is so fast

Tic toc toc tic toc
You already in the past


What goes around comes around  justin timberlake
Time is in the same time my richness and my huge poverty
Minutes gives a rough ra to my pore head to my eyes man to my conscious to my reason
Im feelin the time ,im feelin the punch
I 'm runnin non stop after this kind of sand who's flow into my hand
My calcul control the world, my passion feelin it
My heart beat in the rythm,but my mind tyred 

967 - This Is Why I'm Hot:Mims
[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 1]
This is why I'm hot: I don't gotta rap
I could sell a mill sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say that we lost it so I'ma bring it back
I love the Dirty Dirty 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit the H, I watch 'em get it on the flo'
And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it erryday
Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit L.A
I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way (woo!)
And when I hit the Chi, people say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress, they like my attire
They love how I move crowds from side-to-side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply
 [Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 2]
This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another bitch, another drop
Sixteen bars, twenty-four a pop
Forty-four a song, nigga, gimme what you got
I'm into drivin' cars, fresh up off the lot
I'm into shuttin' stores down just so I could shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me whachu need, you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my homie Black, meet me on the Ave
I hit Wash Heights wit' the money in the bag
We into big spendin', see, my pimpin' never drag
Find me with different women that you niggas never had
For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Player, you come between, you better focus on the beam
I keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean
And when I say I'm hot, my nigga, this is what I mean
[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 3]
This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid and I say "Yeah, I paid a guap"
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way, they call me Cream of the Crop
They hop in the car, I tell 'em "All aboard"
We hit the studio, they say they like how I record
I gave 'em Black Train and I Did You Wrong
So every time I see them, man, they tell me that's they song
They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hangin' from the neck and compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear (Woo!)
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare (Ha!)
Niggas start to hate, rearrange they face
But, little do they know, I keep them things by waist side
I reply "Nobody got to die"
Similar to Lil Weez 'cause I got the fire
[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)12

 [Verse 1: Fergie]
Wear them gold and diamond rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperones and limousines
Shopping for expensive things
I be on the movie screens
Magazines and bougie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine
I still go to Taco Bell
Drive-through, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell
After the show, after the Grammys
I like to go cool out with the family
Sippin' and reminiscin'
On days when I had a Mustang
And now I'm

I'm talking champagne wishes, caviar dreams
You deserve nothing but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue what to do with us
I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us
Plus I gotta keep enough lettuce to support your shoe fetish
Lifestyle so rich and famous, Robin Leach'll get jealous
Half a million for the stones
Taking trips from here to Rome
So if you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home

[Bridge: Fergie]
I got problems up to here, I got people in my ear
Telling me these crazy thangs that I don't wanna know (Fuck y'all)
I got money in the bank, and I'd really like to thank
All the fans, I'd like to thank, thank you, really though
'Cause I remember yesterday, when I dreamt about them days
When I'd rock on MTV, that'd be really dope
Damn, it's been a long road, and the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy told me so, he let his daughter know

[Outro: Fergie & (Polow Da Don)]
(If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home, you say it!)
My daddy told me so
("If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home!")
He let his daughter know

When Timbo' is in the party, everybody put up they hands

I'm a real producer, and you just a piano man
Your songs don't top the charts I heard 'em, I'm not a fan
Niggas talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can
 [Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night

Could you speak up and stop mu-mumbling? I don't think you came in clear
When you're sittin' on the top, it's hard to hear you from way up here
Now I saw you tryna act cute on TV, "Just let me clear the air..."
We missed you on the charts last week damn, that's right, you wasn't there
If s-sexy never left, then why is everybody on my shit?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way
'Cause our run will never be over not, at least, until we say (Uh)

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

972 - Makes Me Wonder:Maroon 5
[Verse 1]
Wake up, blood-shot eye
Struggle to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that
Try to get you back

[Pre-Chorus]
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you

[Chorus]
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye

[Verse 2]
God damn my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I've left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth
 [Pre-Chorus]
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you

[Chorus 2]
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah

I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no, so this is goodbye

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I've been here before
One day I'll wake up and it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so this is goodbye
[Chorus 2]
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah
And you don't how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no, so this is goodbye

975 - Hey There Delilah:Plain White T's
[Verse 1]
Hey there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight, you look so pretty, yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen, close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

[Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

[Verse 2]
Hey there, Delilah, I know times are gettin' hard
But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar, we'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away, I'd write it all
Even more in love with me, you'd fall
We'd have it all
 [Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

[Bridge]
A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes, and trains, and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never, ever be the same
And you're to blame

[Verse 3]
Hey there, Delilah, you be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school, and I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you
[Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

Hold up, wait a minute, do I see what I think I, whoa
Did I think I see shawty get low?
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'ma say that I prefer them no clothes

She threw it back at me, I gave her mo'
Cash ain't no problem, I know where it goes

Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack c'mon, two stacks c'mon
Three stacks c'mon, now that's three grand
What, you think I'm playin', baby girl?
I'm the man, I invented rubber bands
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a soldier, she ready for Rover
I couldn't control her
So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster, she showed her

Lil' mama took my cash

The way she bent that back
Got her them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that
I was on it, sexy woman
Let me showin' and made me want it
Two in the mornin', I'm zonin'
And them Rosay bottles foamin'
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fly just like my Glock

984 - Bleeding Love:Leona Lewis
[Intro]
Hey

[Verse 1]
Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen, ooh
But somethin' happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found somethin' true
And everyone's lookin' 'round thinkin' I'm going crazy
Ooh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
You cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
 [Break]
Mm, yeah

[Verse 2]
Tryin' hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercin' sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from fallin', ooh, yeah
But nothin's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
You cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
[Bridge]
And it's drainin' all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearin' these scars for everyone to see

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'
Ooh, you cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleeding love (You)
Keep bleedin'
Keep, keep bleeding love
Oh, you cut me open and I

Keep, keep bleeding love (You)
I keep bleedin'

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

No tellin' where it'll take ya

My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
(Rihanna, let's get it)
So live your life (AYY!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH!) Ayyy ayyy ayyy
'Cause I'm a paper chaser
[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

[Sample]
Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha-ha
Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha-ha

Too bad for you, you just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many

995 - Crack a Bottle:Eminem featuring Dr. Dre and 50 Cent
[Intro: Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world, Slim Shady

[Hook: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Ok, let's go
Back with Andre the giant, mister elephant tusk
Fix your must, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fumunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man they love me when I lay in the cutt
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty some paper cut
Now picture us, it's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes
 [Hook]

[Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
They see that low rider go by they're like "Oh my"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cause I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say, I love LA
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

[Hook]

[Eminem]
And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the don
I'm King Kong, get rolled, on wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuana, do what you want
Nigga on and on, till the break of what
Get the paper man, I'm caking, you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want so what I trick
Fat ass Birkin bags, some classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes, I say move a bitch move

[Hook]1

Hey, walk out of the house with my swagger
Hop in, there we go, I got places to go

My Benjamin Frank-a-lins
A couple of grands, I got rubberbands
My paper planes making her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We building castles that's made out of sand
She's amazing, her fire blazing, hotter than cajun
Girl, won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belongs on a poster

Doing a show like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever then I'll be your chauffeur, 'cause

Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Bridge]
Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?
 [Verse 3]
To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)
But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Outro]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams95

[Verse 1: JAY-Z & Alicia Keys]
Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, hola, my Dominicanos (Dimelo!)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say "What up?" to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out (Come on), I could trip a referee (Come on)
Tell by my attitude (Come on) that I'm most definitely from

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & JAY-Z]
In New York (Ayy, uh, yeah; aha)
Concrete jungle (Yeah) where dreams are made of

 [Verse 2: JAY-Z & Alicia Keys]
Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed, "I Got It Made"
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three-card Marley
Labor Day Parade rest in peace, Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade (Come on, come on)
Long live the king, yo (Come on) I'm from the Empire State, that's

[Verse 3: JAY-Z & Alicia Keys]
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
"Hail Mary" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA (Come on) got you feelin' like a champion (Come on)
The city never sleeps (Come on), better slip you a Ambien
[Chorus: Alicia Keys & JAY-Z]
In New York (Ayy, ow, uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (Okay)
Now you're in New York (Uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (Okay)
Let's hear it for New York (Uh)
New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)
[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
One hand in the air for the big city (Oh)
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty (Oh)
No place in the world that could compare (Nah)
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
"Yeah, yeah" (Come on, come on)
"Yeah, yeah" (Come on)

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
In New York (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of

Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

1007 - The Sound of Silence:Simon & Garfunkel
[Verse 1]
Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night, and touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 4]
'Fools,' said I, 'You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you'
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, 'The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence'


1008 - Respect:Aretha Franklin

1010 - The Tears of a Clown:Smokey Robinson & the Miracles
[Intro]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Now if there's a smile on my face
It's only there tryin' to fool the public
But when it comes down to foolin' you
Now, honey, that's quite a different subject
But don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Really I'm sad
(Sad, sad, sad, sad)
Oh, sadder than sad
(I'm hurt so bad)
You're gone, and I'm hurtin' so bad
(I pretend to be glad)
Like a clown, I pretend to be glad
(Sad, sad, sad, sad)

[Chorus]
Now there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Mmm-hmm, oh yeah, baby

[Verse 2]
Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride, I've tried
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Decided to go
(Why did you go?)
Oh, I need you so
(I need you so)
I'm hurt and I want you to know
(Want you to know)
But for others I put on a show
(It's just a show) Ooh-oh

[Chorus]
There's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Just like Pagliacci did (The great pretender)
I try to keep my sadness hid
Smiling in the public eye (The great pretender)
But in my lonely room, I cry

[Chorus]
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby

[Outro]
Now if there's a smile on my face (Tears of clown)
Don't let my glad expression (Tears of a clown)
Give you the wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear (Tears of a clown)
Make you think that I don't care
When really I'm sad
Hurtin' so bad (Tears of a clown)
Cryin' all the time...

That this is the law of all the land

A child is Black, a child is white
The whole world looks upon the sight
A beautiful sight

Together they grow to see the light

1012 - You're So Vain:Carly Simon
[Intro]
Son of a gun

[Verse 1]
You walked into the party like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror, as you watched yourself gavotte

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner
They'd be your partner and

[Chorus]
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you?

[Verse 2]
You had me several years ago when I was still quite naive
Well, you said that we made such a pretty pair and that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me

[Pre-Chorus]
I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee and

[Chorus]
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you? Don't you?

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you?

[Verse 3]
Well, I hear you went up to Saratoga
And your horse naturally won
Then you flew your Learjet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun
Well, you're where you should be all the time
And when you're not

[Pre-Chorus]
You're with some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
Wife of a close friend and

[Chorus]
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you? Don't you now?

[Outro]
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you

Very superstitious
Writing's on the wall

Ladder's 'bout to fall

When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, yeah

Wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem
Do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream
Keep me going strong
You don't want to save me
Sad is my song

When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, yeah

Nothing more to say
Very superstitious
The devil's on his way
Thirteen month old baby

Seven years of bad luck
Good things in your past

That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way

1018 - Rich Girl:Daryl Hall and John Oates
[Chorus: Daryl Hall]
You're a rich girl, and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch, girl, but it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money but it won't get you too far
Get you too far

[Verse 1: Daryl Hall & John Oates]
Don't you know? Don't you know?
That it's wrong to take what is given you
So far gone, on your own
You can get along if you try to be strong
But you'll never be strong, 'cause

[Chorus: Daryl Hall & John Oates]
You're a rich girl (Rich girl)
And you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway (Rich girl)
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch, girl (Bitch, girl), and it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway (Rich girl)
Say money but it won't get you too far, get you too far

[Verse 2: Daryl Hall & John Oates]
High and dry, out of the rain
It's so easy to hurt others when you can't feel pain
And don't you know that a love can't grow, ooh
'Cause there's too much to give, 'cause you'd rather live
For the thrill of it all, oh

[Chorus: Daryl Hall & John Oates]
You're a rich girl (Rich girl) and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway (Rich girl)
You can rely on the old man's money

1019 - Don't Give Up on Us:David Soul
Don't give up on us, baby
Don't make the wrong seem right
The future isn't just one night
It's written in the moonlight
And painted on the stars
We can't change ours

Don't give up on us, baby
We're still worth one more try
I know we put a last one by
Just for a rainy evening
When maybe stars are few
Don't give up on us, I know
We can still come through

I really lost my head last night
You've got a right to stop believing
There's still a little love left
Even so

Don't give up on us, baby
Lord knows we've come this far
Can't we stay the way we are?
The angel and the dreamer
Who sometimes plays a fool
Don't give up on us, I know
We can still come through

It's written in the moonlight
And painted on the stars
We can't change ours

Don't give up on us, baby
We're still worth one more try
I know we put a last one by
Just for a rainy evening
When maybe stars are few
Don't give up on us, I know
We can still come through

Don't give up on us, baby
Don't give up on us, baby

1020 - Don't Leave Me This Way:Thelma Houston
[Verse 1]
Don't leave me this way
I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without your love, oh baby
Don't leave me this way, no, I can't exist
I'll surely miss your tender kiss
Don't leave me this way

[Chorus]
(Ahh) Baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
Now come on down and do what you got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control?
Come on, satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good loving can set me free
(Set me free, set me free)

[Verse 2]
Don't, don't you leave me this way, no
Don't you understand, I'm at your command?
Oh baby, please, please don't leave me this way, no, baby
Don't leave me this way, no
I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without your love
Baby, don't leave me this way

[Chorus]
(Ahh) Baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control?
So come on, satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good loving can set me free
(Set me free, set me free) Aye, aye
I need your loving, baby, I need, I need

[Outro]
Satisfy the need in me
Satisfy the need in me
Hey, hey, baby
Come and satisfy the need in me
Oh, woah, baby
Come and satisfy the need in me

Don't leave me this way
No, don't leave me this way
No, don't leave me this way, baby
Don't leave me

1021 - Hotel California:Eagles
[Verse 1]
On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

[Verse 2]
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell'
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

[Chorus]
'Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here'

[Verse 3]
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

[Verse 4]
So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine'
He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969'
And still those voices are callin'
From far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

[Chorus]
'Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis'

[Verse 5]
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice, and she said
'We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device'
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

[Verse 6]
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
'Relax,' said the night man
'We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave'

[Guitar Solo]

1022 - Night Fever:Bee Gees
[Verse 1]
Listen to the ground
There is movement all around
There is something goin' down
And I can feel it
On the waves of the air
There is dancin' out there
If it's somethin' we can share
We can steal it

[Pre-Chorus]
And that sweet city woman, she moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me, yeah, and the feelin' is right

[Chorus]
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

[Verse 3]
Here I am
Prayin' for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Borne on the wind, makin' it mine

[Chorus]
Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

[Verse 4]
In the heat of our love, don't need no help for us to make it
Gimme just enough to take us to the mornin'
I got fire in my mind, I get higher in my walkin'
And I'm glowin' in the dark, I give you warnin'

[Pre-Chorus]
And that sweet city woman, she moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me, yeah, and the feelin' is right

[Chorus]
I get night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

[Verse 3]
Here I am
Prayin' for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Borne on the wind, makin' it mine

[Chorus]
Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

[Outro]
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to do it

1023 - Too Much, Too Little, Too Late:Johnny Mathis and Deniece Williams
Guess it's over, call it a day
Sorry that it had to end this way
No reason to pretend
We knew it had to end some day, this way

Guess, it's over, the kicks are gone
What's the use of tryin' to hang on?
Somewhere we lost the key
So little left for you and me and it's clear to see

Too much, too little, too late to lie again with you
Too much, too little, too late to try again with you
We're in the middle of ending something that we do
It's all over
Oh, it was over

Too much, too little, too late to ever try again
Too much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends
Too much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end
And it's over
It's over

Guess it's over, the chips are down
Nearly all our bridges tumbled down
Whatever chance we try, let's face it, why deny
It's over
It's all over
It's over

Too much, too little, too late to ever try again
Too much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends
Too much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end
And it's over
And it's all over
And it's over

Too much, too little, too late to ever try again
Too much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends
Too much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end

1024 - I Will Survive:Gloria Gaynor
[Intro]
At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong and I learned how to get along

[Verse 1]
And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey

[String Solo]

[Verse 2]
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, I will survive

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 2]
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Well, now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd break down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, I will survive

And I'll survive, yes, I'll survive, yeah, I'll survive

[Verse 1]
Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away (Rock, right)

Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go

When you feel that heat
And we're gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)

1027 - Jessie's Girl:Rick Springfield
[Verse 1]
Jessie is a friend
Yeah, I know, he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl, and I wanna make her mine

[Pre-Chorus]
And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body
I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

[Chorus]
You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?

[Verse 2]
I'll play along with this charade
That doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell her that I love her, but the point is probably moot

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body
I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

[Chorus]
You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?
Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman...
Where can I find a woman like that?

[Bridge]
And I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time
Wonderin' what she don't see in me
I've been funny; I've been cool with the lines
Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?

[Interlude]
Tell me where can I find a woman like that?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I want Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?
Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I want, I want Jessie's girl

[Verse 1]
Easy, ready, willin', overtime

Where do you dare me
To draw the line?
You've got the body
Now you want my soul
Don't even think about it
Say, "No go"

1030 - Don't You Want Me:The Human League
[Verse 1: Philip Oakey]
You were workin' as a waitress in a cocktail bar
When I met you
I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around
Turned you into someone new
Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet
Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget, it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too

[Pre-Chorus: Philip]
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me
It's much too late to find
You think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

[Chorus: Philip]
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me, ohh?
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me, ohh?

[Verse 2: Susan Ann Sulley]
I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place
Either with or without you
The five years we have had have been such good times
I still love you
But now I think it's time I live my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do

[Pre-Chorus: Philip]
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me
It's much too late to find
You think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

[Chorus: Philip]
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me, ohh?
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me, ohh?

1031 - Eye of the Tiger:Survivor
[Verse 1]
Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times, it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger

[Verse 2]
Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger

[Verse 3]
Rising up, straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive

[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger

[Outro]
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger

1032 - Maneater:Daryl Hall and John Oates
[Verse 1]
She'll only come out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new
I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sitting with you, but her eyes are on the door
So many have paid to see what you think you're getting for free
The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed by the purr of a Jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love, you ain't gonna get too far

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater

[Verse 2]
I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's deadly, man
She could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
Ooh, the beauty is there but a beast is in the heart

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater

Ooh, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes, she's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes, watch out)
She'll only come out at night, ooh
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes, she's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes, she's a maneater)
The woman is wild, woo
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes, watch out, boy, watch out, boy
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Oh, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out
(Oh-oh, here she comes, watch out)
Yeah, yeah, she's a maneater

She's watching and waiting, ooh

Oh, she's a maneater

1033 - Africa:Toto
[Verse 1: David Paich]
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
'Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you'

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (Ooh)

[Verse 2: David Paich]
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

[Bridge: David Paich & Bobby Kimball]
Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa (Gonna take the time)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

[Fiddle Tune]

[Intro]
Come on, Eileen
Come on, Eileen

[Verse 1]
Poor old Johnny Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
Moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried
Sang along, who'd blame them?
You're grown (You're grown up)
So grown (So grown up)
Now I must say more than ever (Come on, Eileen)
Toora, loora, toora, loo-rye-aye
And we can sing just like our fathers

My thoughts, I confess
Verge on dirty
Oh, come on, Eileen

Come on, Eileen

[Verse 2]
These people 'round here
Were beaten down, eyes sunk in smoke-dried face
They're resigned to what their fate is
But no, not us (No, never)
No, not us (No, never)
We are far too young and clever (Remember)
Toora, loora, toora, loo-rye-aye
Eileen, I'll hum this tune forever

Come on, Eileen
Oh, I swear (Well, he means)
Ah, come on, let's
Take off everything
That pretty red dress

That pretty red dress
Eileen (Tell him yes)
Ah, come on, let's
Ah, come on, Eileen
Please

Come on, Eileen (You've grown)
(Come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
These things, they are real and I know (So grown)
(Come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
How you feel
Now I must say more than ever (Toora, toora, ta-loora)
Things 'round here have changed, I said
Toora, loora, toora, loo-rye-aye
(Come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
(Come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
(Toora, toora, ta-loora)

[Chorus]
Come on, Eileen
Oh, I swear (Well, he means)
At this moment
You mean everything
You in that dress
My thoughts, I confess
Verge on dirty
Ah, come on, Eileen

Oh, I swear (Well, he means)
At this moment
You mean everything
In that dress
Oh, my thoughts, I confess
Well, they're dirty

In that dress
Woah (I confess)

That I gaze on so fondly today
Were to suddenly leave you or fly in the night
Just like fairy gifts gone in the sky

1035 - Karma Chameleon:Culture Club
[Verse 1]
Desert loving in your eyes all the way
If I listened to your lies, would you say

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a man without conviction?
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sell a contradiction?
You come and go, you come and go

[Chorus]
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dream
Red, gold and green, red, gold and green

[Verse 2]
Didn't hear your wicked words every day
And you used to be so sweet, I heard you say

[Pre-Chorus]
That my love was an addiction
When we cling, our love is strong
When you go, you're gone forever
You string along, you string along

[Chorus]
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dream
Red, gold and green, red, gold and green

Every day is like survival
You're my lover, not my rival
Every day is like survival
You're my lover, not my rival

I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sell a contradiction
You come and go, you come and go

Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dream

Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dream

Been working so hard

Oh, tell me what I got

That time's just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town

You'll get by if you'd only

1038 - The Way It Is:Bruce Hornsby & the Range
[Instrumental Intro 00:00-00:50]

[Verse 1]
Standing in line, marking time
Waiting for the welfare dime
'Cause they can't buy a job
The man in the silk suit hurries by
As he catches the poor old lady's eyes
Just for fun, he says, "Get a job"

[Chorus]
That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is
Ha, but don't you believe them

[Verse 2]
Said, "Hey, little boy, you can't go where the others go
'Cause you don't look like they do"
Said, "Hey old man, how can you stand to think that way?
Did you really think about it before you made the rules?"
He said "Son"

[Chorus]
That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is
Ha, but don't you believe them
Yeah

[Piano Solo]

[Bridge]
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is

[Verse 3]
Well, they passed a law in '64
To give those who ain't got a little more
But it only goes so far
'Cause the law don't change another's mind
When all it sees at the hiring time
Is the line on the color bar, no

[Chorus]
That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is, it is, it is, it is

1039 - Man in the Mirror:Michael Jackson
[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

[Bridge]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

[Chorus]
(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ooh!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man)
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!

[Outro]
Hoo, hoo (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana), hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Gonna feel real good (Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself, (Yeah) hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, hoo!
(Man in the mirror) You got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo! (Yeah)
You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You got to, you got to move, shamone, shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah), stand up (Make that change), stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)
Hoo, hoo, hoo! Aaow! (Yeah, make that change)
Go make that change, shamone (Man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know (Change)
Make that change

1040 - Eternal Flame:The Bangles
[Verse 1]
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand?
Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning an eternal flame?

I believe it's meant to be, darling
I watch you when you are sleeping

Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling

1041 - More Than Words:Extreme
[Verse 1]
Saying 'I love you'
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel

[Pre-Chorus]
More than words
Is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

[Chorus]
What would you do
If my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say
If I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying, 'I love you'

[Post-Chorus]
Da-de-da-la-de-da
La-de-dei-dei-dei
More than words
Da-de-da-la-de-da

[Verse 2]
Now that I've tried to
Talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands
And touch me, hold me close, don't ever let me go

[Pre-Chorus]
More than words
Is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

[Chorus]
What would you do
If my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say
If I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying, 'I love you'

[Post-Chorus]
Da-de-da-la-de-da
La-de-dei-dei-dei
More than words
Da-de-da-la-de-da
La-de-dei-dei-dei
More than words
La-de-dei-dei-dei
La-de-dei-dei-dei
La-de-dei-dei-dei
More than words
More than words

[Outro]
More than words

Show me what he's done to you
Stand up, little girl

Fate will twist the both of you
So come on, baby, come on over
Let me be the one to show you

Build up your confidence
So you can be on top for once
Wake up! Who cares about

You can make my life worth while
I can make you start to smile

So come on, baby, come on over
Let me be the one to show you

[Chorus]
I'm the one who wants to be with you (I'm the one)
Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too (feel it too)
Waited on a line of greens and blues (waited on a line, yeah)
Just to be the next to be with you

[Coda]
I'm the one who wants to be with you (I'm the one)
Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too (deep inside, you feel it too)
Waited on a line of greens and blues (waited on that line, yeah)
Just to be the next to be with you
Just to be the next to be with you, ooh

'Cause I'll be kicking the flavor that makes you wanna jump
How high? Real high 'cause I'm just so fly
A young lovable, huggable type of guy
And everything is to the back with a little slack
'Cause inside out, it's wiggida wiggida wiggida wack
I come stompin' with somethin' pumpin' to keep you jumpin'
R&B rap is bullcrap is what I'm dumpin'

They tried to step to the Mac then they got jacked
To the back you'll be sportin' the gear; is that coincidental?
Act like you know and don't be claiming that it's mental

1044 - Waterfalls:TLC
[Verse 1: T-Boz]
A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep himself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

[Chorus: T-Boz & TLC]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, 'Baby, it's good to me'
One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading, and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me

[Chorus: T-Boz & TLC, Chilli]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
(Your way or no way)
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Come on!
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray
All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

[Chorus: T-Boz & TLC, Chilli]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast)
Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
(I know, I know, your way hey)
But I think you're moving too fast

1045 - How Do U Want It:2Pac featuring K-Ci & JoJo
[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it yeah?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit, you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police, catch me if you can
Forgive me, I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin, bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me; Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
How do you want it?
How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk? Am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor, it's like erotic
Ironic, 'cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches
Like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
'Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get to rockin' these, nights full of Aliz
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
These niggas play these Cali days
C. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga, you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us, I could give a fuck
Like we the first ones to bomb and cuss
Nigga, tell me how you want it

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Raised as a youth, tell the truth
I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Lickin' shots off from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is lookin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I'm with a clique that's quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
When you see me, tell a nigga how you want it
How do you want it?

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Me and my Nigga Johnny J...yeah we out

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

[Outro: K-Ci & JoJo]

Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

1046 - My Heart Will Go On:Celine Dion
[Verse 1]
Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

[Chorus]
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more, you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

[Verse 2]
Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go 'til we're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time I'd hold to
In my life, we'll always go on

[Chorus]
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
(Why does the heart go on?)
Once more, you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
You're here, there's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you
It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one, oh

I can feel something inside me say

[Verse 2]
What am I supposed to do
Sit around and wait for you?
Well, I can't do that
And there's no turning back
I need time to move on
I need love to feel strong
'Cause I've had time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you, oh

[Chorus]
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
'I really don't think you're strong enough, no'
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
'I really don't think you're strong enough, no'

Well, I know that I'll get through this
'Cause I know that I am strong
I don't need you anymore
Oh, I don't need you anymore
Oh, I don't need you anymore
No, I don't need you anymore

'I really don't think you're strong enough, no'
Do you believe in life after love?

1050 - Firework:Katy Perry
[Verse 1]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, 'Awe, awe, awe'
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, 'Awe, awe, awe'
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

[Verse 2]
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, 'Awe, awe, awe'
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, 'Awe, awe, awe'
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

[Bridge]
'Boom, boom, boom'
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it throu-ou-ough

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, 'Awe, awe, awe,'
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, 'Awe, awe, awe'
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

1051 - Call Me Maybe:Carly Rae Jepsen
[Verse 1]
I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me, maybe

[Verse 2]
You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothin' at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me, maybe

[Post-Chorus]
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad

[Bridge]
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me, maybe

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me, maybe

[Post-Chorus]
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that
So call me, maybe

Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know

[Intro]
KSR
It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I don't gotta dance

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 1]
Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, 'Goals,' bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, 'Okay'
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money moves
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 2]
If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

1056 - Perfect:Ed Sheeran
[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

[Pre-Chorus]
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight

[Bridge]
No, no, no
Mm, no, no

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person and she looks perfect
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight

[Intro: Drake]
Astro, yeah

Sun is down, freezin' cold

Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

[Refrain: Big Hawk & Swae Lee]
Some-Some-Some-Someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep

To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-Play-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak

[Verse 3: Travis Scott & Uncle Luke]
Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, 'Hop in, you comin' too'
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, 'Where we goin'?' I said, 'The moon'
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

[Refrain: Travis Scott, Swae Lee & Big Hawk]
Someone said
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue
Someone said
Play-Playin' for keeps
Someone said, mother****, someone said
Don't play us for weak

I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)

[Verse 1]
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche

1063 - Viva la Vida:Coldplay
[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemies' eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
'Now the old king is dead, long live the king'
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Hear Jerusalem bells are ringin'
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
My missionaries in a foreign field
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
For some reason I can't explain
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

1064 - I Kissed a Girl:Katy Perry
[Verse 1]
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Verse 2]
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Bridge]
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street
With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, tryna ask me shit
When my niggas fill your vest, they ain't gon' pass me shit
You should think about it, take a second *Ding*
Matter-fact, you should take four, B

Oh, you got a gun, so you wanna pop back?

Pistol-whip you, dip you, then flip you
Then dance to this mothafuckin' music we Crip to
Subscribe, nigga, get your issue

When the pimp's in the crib, ma

When I talk to my friends so quietly
("Who he think he is?") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress

It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this

[Chorus: Andr 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
My baby's drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

[Chorus: Andr 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Bridge: Andr 3000]
Me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on
You say it's puppy love; we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson

[Verse 2: Andr 3000]
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

[Chorus: Andr 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
"Look at the way he treats me"
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song; let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama

[Chorus: Andr 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

1069 - Say My Name:Destiny's Child
[Intro: Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins]
Darkchild '99

[Chorus: Beyonc, Destiny's Child, LeToya Luckett & Destiny's Child]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me "Baby"
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me "Baby"
Better say my name

[Verse 1: Beyonc]
Any other day I would call you would say (Say)
"Baby, how's your day?" But today it ain't the same
Every other word is "Uh-huh (Uh-huh), yeah, okay" (Okay)
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady? (Another lady)
If you took it there first of all let me say (Say)
I am not the one to sit around and be played
So prove yourself to me if I'm the girl that you claim (Claim)
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday? (Yesterday)

[Pre-Chorus: Destinys Child, Beyonc]
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
Where you're sayin' everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who

[Chorus: Beyonc, Destiny's Child, LeToya Luckett & Destiny's Child]
Say my name, say my name (Say my name, is around you)
If no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you" (Love you)
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name (Say my name, say my name)
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me "Baby" (Baby, hey, yeah)
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game (No, no)
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me "Baby"
Better say my name

[Verse 2: Beyonc]
What is up with this? Tell the truth, who you with? (With)
How would you like it if I came over with my clique?
Don't try to change it now sayin' you gotta bounce (Bounce)
When two seconds ago said you just got in the house (The house)
It's hard to believe that you are at home by yourself (By yourself)
When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else
Just this question, why do you feel (Feel) you gotta lie? (L-Lie)
Gettin' caught up in your game when you cannot say my name
(Say my, say my name)

[Pre-Chorus: Destinys Child, Beyonc]
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're actin' strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
Where you're sayin' everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who

[Chorus: Beyonc, Destiny's Child, LeToya Luckett & Destiny's Child]

Say my name, say my name (Say my name, say my name)
You actin' kinda shady (Say my name)
Ain't callin' me "Baby"
Why the sudden change? (Sudden change)
Say my name, say my name (Say my name)
